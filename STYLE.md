Chapter and section headings
========

Only the first word of the headings should be capitalized. (This is
different from the style used in the 1965 edition, which used titlecase.)

Modern units and symbols for units should be used: s, not sec; A, not amp;
pF, not uuF; nm, not angstroms. In expressions like N.m for mechanical work,
use a dot (LaTeX command \unitdot), not a dash as Purcell does (N-m).
