Purcell, Electricity and Magnetism
============

This classic textbook was written during the Sputnik era as part of a collaboration
at UC Berkeley
funded by the National Science Foundation. The copyright page of the original 1965 edition
includes a notice stating that it is available for use by authors and publishers on
a royalty-free basis after 1970. The book has gone through two more editions since then,
with many improvements. The third edition, by Purcell and Morin, is in print as of 2013.

My initial purpose in this project is to produce a verbatim edition, in LaTeX format,
of the free 1965 version, which will be free for everyone to use.

For more legal details, see the COPYRIGHT file and the copyright page of the book itself.

I request that users of this book not be jerks. In particular, the commercial edition
has a solutions manual covering the ``exercises,'' i.e., the subset of the problems that don't have
solutions in the back of the book. It would be an antisocial act to distribute solutions
to these indiscriminately.
