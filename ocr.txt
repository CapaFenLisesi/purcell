Chapter 1 Electrostatics: Charges and Fields

1.1 Electric Charge

Electricity appeared to its early investigators as an extraordinary
phenomenon. To draw from bodies the subtle fire, as it was sometimes
called, to bring an object into a highly electrified state, to
produce a steady flow of current, called for skillful contrivance.
Except for the spectacle of lightning, the ordinary manifestations
of nature, from the freezing of water to the growth of a tree, seemed
to have no relation to the curious behavior of electrified objects.
We know now that electrical forces largely determine the physical
and chemical properties of matter over the whole range from atom
to living cell. For this understanding we have to thank the scientists
of the nineteenth century, Ampere, Faraday, Maxwell, and many
others, who discovered the nature of electromagnetism, as well as the
physicists and chemists of the twentieth century who unraveled the
atomic structure of matter.

Classical electromagnetism deals with electric charges and currents
and their interactions as if all the quantities involved could be measured
independently, with unlimited precision. Here classical means
simply "non-quantum." The quantum law with its constant h is
ignored in the classical theory of electromagnetism, just as it is in
ordinary mechanics. Indeed, the classical theory was brought very
nearly to its present state of completion before Planck's discovery.
It has survived remarkably well. Neither the revolution of quantum
physics nor the development of special relativity dimmed the luster
of the electromagnetic field equations Maxwell wrote down a hundred
years ago.

Of course, the theory was solidly based on experiment, and because
of that was fairly secure within its original range of application
---to coils, capacitors, oscillating currents, eventually radio waves
and light waves. But even so great a success does not guarantee
validity in another domain, for instance, the inside of a molecule.

Two facts help to explain the continuing importance in modern
physics of the classical description of electromagnetism. First,
special relativity required no revision of classical electromagnetism.
Historically speaking, special relativity grew out of classical electromagnetic
theory and experiments inspired by it. Maxwell's field
equations, developed long before the work of Lorentz and Einstein,
proved to be entirely compatible with relativity. Second, quantum

modifications of the electromagnetic forces have turned out to be
unimportant down to distances less than 10'1° cm, a hundred times
smaller than the atom. We can describe the repulsion and attraction
of particles in the atom using the same laws that apply to the leaves
of an electroscope, although we need quantum mechanics to predict
how the particles will behave under those forces. For still smaller
distances, there is a rather successful fusion of electromagnetic
theory and quantum theory, called quantum electrodynamics, which
seems to agree with experiment down to the smallest distances yet
explored.

We assume the reader has some acquaintance with the elementary
facts of electricity. We are not going to review all the experiments
by which the existence of electric charge was demonstrated or all the
evidence for the electrical constitution of matter. On the other hand,
we do want to look carefully at the experimental foundations of the
basic laws on which all else depends. In this chapter we shall study
the physics of stationary electric charges---electrostatics.

Certainly one fundamental property of electric charge is its existence
in the two varieties that were long ago named positive and
negative. The observed fact is that all charged particles can be
divided into two classes such that all members of one class repel each
other, while attracting members of the other class. If two small
electrically charged bodies A and B, some distance apart, repel one
another, and if A attracts some third electrified body C, then we
always find that B attracts C. Why this universal law prevails we
cannot say for sure. But today physicists tend to regard positive and
negative charge as, fundamentally, opposite manifestations of one
quality, much as "right" and "left" are opposite manifestations of
"handedness." Indeed, the\question of symmetry involved in right
and left seems to be intimately related to this duality of electric
charge, and to another fundamental symmetry, the two directions
of time. Elementary particle physics is throwing some light on these
questions.

What we call negative charge could just as well have been called
positive, and vice versa.T The choice was a historical accident. Our
universe appears to be a very evenly balanced mixture of positive and
negative electric charge, which, since like charges repel one another,
is not surprising.

TThe charge of the ordinary electron has nothing intrinsically negative about it. A
negative integer, once multiplication has been defined, differs essentially from a positive
integer in that its square is an integer of opposite sign. But the product of two charges
is not a charge: there is no comparison.

% p. 4
Two other observed properties of electric charge are essential in the
lectrical structure of matter: charge is conserved, and charge is
uantized. These properties involve quantity of charge, and thus
nply a measurement of charge. Presently we shall state precisely
ow charge can be measured in terms of the force between charges

certain distance apart, and so on. But let us take this for granted,

)1' the time being, so that we may talk freely about these funda-
iental facts.

.2 Conservation of Charge

The total charge in an isolated system never changes. By isolated
re mean that no matter is allowed to cross the boundary of the sys-
am. We could let light pass into or out of the system without alTect---
ig the principle, since photons carry no charge. For instance, a
min-walled box in a vacuum, exposed to gamma rays, might become
me scene of a "pair-creation" event in which a high-energy photon
nds its existence with the creation of a negative electron and a
ositive electron (Fig. 1.1). Two electrically charged particles have
een newly created but the net change in total charge, in and on the
ox, is zero. An event that would violate the law we have just stated
would be the creation of a positively charged particle without the
imultaneous creation of a negatively charged particle. Such an
ccurrence has never been observed.

Of course, if the electric charges of electron and positron were not
rrecisely equal in magnitude, pair creation would still violate the
trict law of charge conservation. As well as can be determined from
xperiment, their charges are equal. An interesting experimental test
; provided by the structure called positronium, a structure composed
~f an electron and a positron, and nothing else. This curious "atom"
an live long enough---a tenth of a microsecond or so---to be studied
1 detail. It behaves as if it were quite neutral, electrically. Actually,
nost physicists would be astonished, not to say incredulous, if any
lifference were found in the magnitudes of these charges, for we
now that electron and positron are related to one another as
article to antiparticle. Their exact equality of charge, like their
quality of mass, is a manifestation of an apparently universal sym-
netry in nature, the particle-antiparticle duality. One might wonder
/hether charge conservation, then, is merely a corollary of some
uroader conservation law governing the creation and annihilation
»f particles; or is charge conservation a primary requirement, with
vhich other laws have to fall in line? Or do these questions make
ense? We do not know for sure.

% p. 5
One thing will become clear in the course of our study of electro-
magnetism: nonconservation of charge would be quite incompatible
with the structure of our present electromagnetic theory. We may
therefore state either as a postulate of the theory or as an empirical

law supported without exception by all observations so far, the
charge conservation law:

The total electric charge in an isolated system, that is,

the algebraic sum of the positive and negative charge
present at any time, never changes.

 

Sooner or later we must ask whether this law meets the test of
relativistic invariance. We shall postpone until Chap. 5 a thorough
discussion of this important question. But the answer is that it does,
and not merely in the sense that the statement above holds in any
given inertial frame, but in the stronger sense that observers in different
frames, measuring the charge, get the same number. In other

words the total electric charge of an isolated system is a relativistically
invariant number.

1.3 Quantization of Charge

Millikan's oil-drop experiment, and innumerable other experi-
ments, have shown that in nature electric charge comes in units of
one magnitude only. That magnitude we denote by e, the electronic
charge. We have already noted that the positron has precisely this
amount of charge. What seems more remarkable is the exact
equality in the charges carried by all other charged particles---the
equality, for instance, in the magnitude of the positive charge on the
proton and the negative charge on the electron.

That particular equality, the proton-electron charge balance, is
open to a very sensitive test. One can test the normal hydrogen atom
or molecule for overall electrical neutrality. Thus, one could try to
deflect a beam of atoms or molecules by an electrical field. In a
sensitive experiment devised for this purpose,]' a sharply defined
beam of cesium atoms was sent, in a high vacuum, through a strong
electric field. From the absence of any observable deflection it could
be concluded that the net charge on a cesium atom must be less than
l0'16e. An even more sensitive test has recently been made by a

fferent method.T A large amount of hydrogen gas was compressed
to a tank which was itself highly insulated, electrically, from its
rroundings. The gas was then allowed to escape from the tank by
sans which prevented the escape of any ordinary ions. If the
arge on the proton differed from that on the electron by, say, one
rt in a billion, then each hydrogen molecule, composed of two
otons and two electrons, would carry a charge of 2 X l0'9e, and
3 departure of the whole mass of hydrogen would measurably alter
e electrical charge and potential of the tank. In fact, the experi-
:nt could have revealed a residual charge as small as l0'2°e per
am, and none was observed! We conclude that the electron and
oton have equal charge, to an accuracy of 1 part in 1020.
On present ideas, the electron and the proton are about as unlike
two elementary particles can be. No one yet understands why
eir charges should have to be equal to such a fantastically precise
gree. Evidently the quantization of charge is a deep and universal
w of nature. All charged elementary particles, as far as we can
termine, carry charges of precisely the same magnitude. We can
lly hope that some future discovery or theoretical insight may
veal to us why a particle with a charge 0.500e, or 0.999e, cannot
.ist.jc
The fact of charge quantization lies outside the scope of classical
zctromagnetism, of course. We shall usually ignore it, and act as if
ll' point charges q could have any strength whatever. This will not
t us into trouble. Still, it is worth remembering that classical
eory cannot be expected to explain the structure of the elementary
rticles. (It is not certain that present quantum theory can either!)
hat holds the electron together is as mysterious as what fixes the
ecise value of its charge. Something more than electrical forces
ust be involved, for the electrostatic forces between different parts
the electron would be repulsive.
In our study of electricity and magnetism we shall treat the charged
LTIICICS simply as carriers of charge, with dimensions so small that

their extension and structure is for most purposes quite insignificant.
In the case of the proton for example, we know from high-energy
scattering experiments that the electric charge does not extend appreciably
beyond a radius of l0"13 cm. We recall that Rutherford's
analysis of the scattering of alpha particles showed that even heavy
nuclei have their electric charge distributed over a region smaller
than l0'11 cm. For the physicist of the nineteenth century a "point
charge" remained an abstract notion, of which a charged pith ball
was a pretty poor realization. Today we are on familiar terms with
the atomic particles. The graininess of electricity is so conspicuous
in our modern description of nature that we find a point charge less
of an artificial idealization than a smoothly varying distribution of
charge density. When we postulate such smooth charge distribu-
tions, we may think of them as averages over very large numbers of
elementary charges, in the same way that we can define the macroscopic
density of a liquid, its lumpiness on a molecular scale not-
withstanding. On objects much bigger than Millikan's oil drops
the quantization of charge is not very noticeable!

1.4 Coulomb's Law

As you probably already know, the interaction between electric
charges at rest is described by Coulomb's law: Two stationary electric
charges repel or attract one another with a force proportional to
the product of the magnitude of the charges and inversely proportional
to the square of the distance between them.

We can state this compactly in vector form:

_ q1q2f21
F2 _ kfl, (1)

Here ql and q2 are numbers (scalars) giving the magnitude and sign
of the respective charges, f-21 is the unit vector in the directionf from
charge 1 to charge 2, and F2 is the force acting on charge 2. Thus
Eq. 1 expresses, among other things, the fact that like charges repel
and unlike attract, and that the force is Newtonian; that is, F 2 = -F1.

The unit vector fgl shows that the force is parallel to the line joining
the charges. It could not be otherwise unless space itself has
some built-in directional property, for with two point charges alone
in empty and isotropic space, no other direction could be singled out.

'lThe convention we adopt here may not seem the natural choice, but it is more con-

sistent with the usage in some other parts of physics and we shall try to follow it throughout
this book.

% p. 8
[f the "point charge" itself had some internal structure, with an axis
defining a direction, then it would have to be described by more than
the mere scalar quantity q.

We suppose, in writing Eq. 1, that both charges are well localized,
occupying regions small compared to 1'21; if not, r21 could not be
defined so as to make Eq. 1 generally valid. The restriction to stationary
charges is made, for the present, to exclude the question of
magnetic forces arising from moving charges, which we shall study
in a later chapter.

The constant k has been included in Eq. 1 to take care of the units.
Usually we shall choose to measure r21 in centimeters; F in dynes;
and charge in CGS electrostatic units, or esu. In that case, k is exactly
one. Two charges each of one esu repel each other with a force of
one dyne when they are one centimeter apart; we may regard Eq. 1,
with k = 1, as providing the definition of the unit of charge in the
CGS electrostatic system of units. Sometimes we shall use the
coulomb as the unit of charge. This unit is usually encountered in
the company of meter-kilogram-second units. Its magnitude is such
that with charge expressed in coulombs, and distance in meters,
Eq. 1 gives the force in newtons, providing k is given the value
8.9875 X 109. The reason for introducing the coulomb is its simple
relation to the common electrical units (ampere, volt, ohm, and
watt), which we use in engineering, in the laboratory, and in our
everyday life. A charge of one coulomb amounts to 2.998 x 109 esu.'l'

The only way we have of detecting and measuring electric charges
is by observing the interaction of charged bodies. One might
wonder, then, how much of the apparent content of Coulomb's law is
really only definition. As it stands, the significant physical content is
the statement of inverse-square dependence, and the implication that
electric charge is additive in its effect. To bring out the latter point,
we have to consider more than two charges. After all, if we had only
two charges in the world to experiment with, ql and qg, we could never
measure them separately. We could verify only that F is proportional
to 1/r212. Suppose we have three bodies carrying charges q1, q2,
and q3. We can measure the force on q1 when qg is 10 cm away from
ql and q3 is very far away, as in Fig. 1.2a. Then we can take qg

TThe number 2.998 which appears above and will appear later in other electrical unit
conversions may remind you of the speed of light. In fact that is where it comes from,
by a route we need not now explore. Often you will find in books and tables simply the
factor 3 instead. Strictly, every factor 3 in an electrical unit conversion ought to be

2.99792\ldots , or whatever is the established significant-figure part of the speed of light
in metric units.

% p. 9
away, bring q3 into q2's former position and again measure the force
on q1. Finally, we bring qg and q3 very close together and locate the
combination 10 cm from ql. We find by measurement that the force
on ql is equal to the sum of the forces previously measured. This is
a significant result that could not have been predicted by logical
arguments from symmetry like the one we used above to show that
the force between two point charges had to be along the line joining
them. The force with which two charges interact is not changed by
the presence of a third charge.

No matter how many charges we have in our system, Coulomb's
law (Eq. 1) can be used to calculate the interaction of every pair.
This is the basis of a principle of superposition, which we shall invoke
again and again in our study of electromagnetism. Superposition
means combining two sets of sources into one system by adding the
second system "on top of" the first without altering the configuration
of either one. Our principle assures us that the force on a charge
placed at any point in the combined system will be the vector sum
of the forces that each set of sources, acting alone, causes to act on a
charge at that point. This principle must not be taken lightly for
granted. There may well be a domain of phenomena, involving
very small distances or very intense forces, where superposition no
longer holds. Indeed, we know of quantum phenomena in the electromagnetic
field which do represent a failure of superposition, seen
from the viewpoint of the classical theory.

Thus the physics of electrical interactions comes into full view
only when we have more than two charges. We can go beyond the
explicit statement of Eq. 1 and assert that with the three charges in
Fig. 1.2 occupying any positions whatever, the force on any one of
them, such as q3, is correctly given by this equation:

F, :  + 2%; (2)
T31 T32

Equation 2 applies for instance to the situation shown in Fig. 1.3.

As for the inverse-square law, its experimental verification, over
a certain range of distances, leaves little to be desired. In 1785
Coulomb measured with a torsion balance the force between small
charged spheres. Many years before Coulomb, Priestley had sug-
gested, by analogy with the gravitational field, that the absence of
electrical influence inside a hollow charged sphere was proof of an
inverse-square force. Henry Cavendish, the British experimental
genius whose work was largely unknown to his contemporaries,
carried out in 1772 a test of the inverse-square law accurate to about

% p. 10
2 percent. Cavendish charged a spherical shell, which could then be
separated into two halves to expose an inner globe. The absence of
charge on the inner globe was proof of the inverse-square law.'l'
Modern repetitions of Cavendish's testj: have, in effect, checked the
inverse-square law, over distances of the order of inches or feet, to an
accuracy of a few parts in 109.

Sometimes this experimental result is described as a test of the
"exponent" in the inverse-square law. However, the real question
is not whether -2 or some other number like - 1.99998 is the correct
exponent, but rather at what range of distances, if any, the inverse-
square law breaks down. There are two domains in either of which,
for all we can prove today by direct experiment, a breakdown might
occur. The first is the domain of very small distances, distances
less than 10*" cm where, as we have already said, we have no assurance
that electromagnetic theory will work at all. But also at very
large distances, from the geographical, say, to the astronomical, we
have no experimental test of Coulomb's law as such. Now we have
no particular reason to expect a breakdown at large distances. In
fact the modern quantum theory of the electromagnetic field gives
some basis for arguing that Coulomb's law holds over distances very
much greater than those used in the latter-day Cavendish experi-
ments. The reason is that a cutoff, at large distances, of the inverse-
square force would imply a small but finite rest mass for the light
quantum, or photon, and consequently a slight variation with
wavelength in the speed of electromagnetic waves in vacuum. It is
known from direct observation§ that short radio waves travel
through vacuum with the same speed as visible light, to an experimental
accuracy at least as good as one part in 106. From this it is
possible to argue theoretically that Coulomb's law ought to be good
up to distances of several kilometers at least. Probably even stronger
indirect arguments of this sort could be made.

To summarize, we have every reason for confidence in Coulomb's
law over the enormous range from 10*" cm to many kilometers, if

not farther, and we take it as the foundation of our description of
electromagnetism.

'l'As we shall discuss in Chap. 3, the field is zero inside any conducting shell, spherical
or not. Cavendish, reasoning like Priestley by analogy with gravitation, seems not to
have been aware of this more general consequence of the inverse-square law.

§The best evidence so far is a recent observation of the practically simultaneous
(within a few minutes, at most) arrival at the earth of radio emissions and light emissions

Whipple, and L. H. Solomon, Nature 202, 377 (I964)].

1.5 Energy of a System of Charges

In principle, Coulomb's law is all there is to electrostatics. Given
the charges and their locations we can find all the electrical forces.
Or given that the charges are free to move under the influence of
other kinds of forces as well, we can find the equilibrium arrangement
in which the charge distribution will remain stationary. In the same
sense, Newton's laws of motion are all there is to mechanics. But in
both mechanics and electromagnetism we gain power and insight by
introducing other concepts, most notably that of energy.

Energy is a useful concept here because electric forces are conserva-
tive. Consider first the work which must be done on the system to
bring some charged bodies into a particular arrangement. Let us start
with two charged bodies or particles very far apart from one another,
as indicated at the top of Fig. 1.4, carrying charges ql and q2. What-
ever energy may have been needed to create these two concentrations
of charge originally we shall leave entirely out of account. Bring the
particles slowly together until the distance between them is r12. How
much work does this take?

It makes no difference whether we bring ql toward qg or the other
way around. In either case the work done is the integral of the prod-
uct: force times displacement-in-direction-of-force. The force that

has to be applied to move one charge toward the other is equal and
opposite to the coulomb force.

W = f force >< distance = J; r_1:O Tq1q2(2_dr) = qlqz (3)

1' T12

Because r is changing from co to r12, the increment of displacement is
-dr. We know the work done on the system must be positive for
charges of like sign; they have to be pushed together. With ql and q2
in esu, and r12 in centimeters, Eq. 3 gives the work in ergs.

From our study of conservative forces in Vol. I (see especially
page 145, Vol. I), we know that this work is the same whatever the
path of approach. Let's review the argument as it applies to the two
charges q1 and q2 in Fig. 1.5. There we have kept ql fixed and we
show qg moved to the same final position along two different paths.
Every spherical shell such as the one indicated between r and r + dr
must be crossed by both paths. The increment of work involved,
-F - ds in this bit of path, is the same for the two paths. The reason
is that F has the same magnitude at both places and is directed
radially from ql, while ds = dr/cos 0; hence F-ds = F dr. Each
increment of work along one path is matched by a corresponding
increment on the other, so the sums must be equal. Our conclusion

 

 

% p. 12
holds even for paths that loop in and out, like the dotted path in
Fig. 1.5. (Why?)

Returning now to the two charges as we left them in Fig. l.4b, let
us bring in from some remote place a third charge q3 and move it to a
point P3 whose distance from charge 1 is r31 cm and from charge 2,
r32 cm. The work required to efiect this will be

W3 = -f°:3F3 ' dS 

Thanks to the additivity of electrical interactions, which we have
already emphasized,

-fF3-ds= -f(F31+F32)-ds= _fF31-dr_fF32-dr (5)

That is, the work to bring q3 to P3 is the sum of the work needed when
ql is present alone and that needed when qg is present alone.

W3 = 119.3. + 'W3 (6)
731 732

The total work done in assembling this arrangement of three charges,
which we shall call U, is therefore

U: qiqz + Cliqs + (ms (7)
712 T13 7'23

We note that q1, ([2, and q3 appear symmetrically in the expression
above, in spite of the fact that q3 was brought up last. We would have
reached the same result if q3 had been brought in first. (Try it.)
Thus U is independent of the order in which the charges were assem-
bled. Since it is independent also of the route by which each charge

was brought in, U must be a unique property of the final arrangement
of charges. We may call it the electrical potential energy of this particular
system. There is a certain arbitrariness, as always, in the definition
of a potential energy. In this case we have chosen the zero
of potential energy to correspond to the situation with the three
charges already in existence but infinitely far apart from one another.
The potential energy belongs to the configuration as a whole. There
is no meaningful way of assigning a certain fraction of it to one of the
charges.

It is obvious how this very simple result can be generalized to
apply to any number of charges. If we have N different charges, in
any arrangement in space, the potential energy of the system is calculated
by summing over all pairs, just as in Eq. 7. The zero of

% p. 13
potential energy, as in that case, corresponds to all charges far apart.

As an example, let us calculate the potential energy of an arrangement
of eight negative charges on the corners of a cube of side b,
with a positive charge in the center of the cube, as in Fig. 1.6a. Sup-
pose each negative charge is an electron with charge -e, while the

central particle carries a double positive charge, 2e. Summing over
all pairs, we have:

U__si_i)+ 12e2 12e2 4e2 _4.32e2 (8)
_(\/3/2)b b fib \/ab' b

Figure 1.6}: shows where each term in this sum comes from. The
energy is positive, indicating that work had to be done on the system
to assemble it. That work could, of course, be recovered if we let the
charges move apart, exerting forces on some external body or bodies.
Or if the electrons were simply to ffy apart from this configuration,
the total kinetic energy of all the particles would become equal to U.
This would be true whether they came apart simultaneously and
symmetrically, or were released one at a time in any order. Here
we see the power of this simple notion of the total potential energy
of the system. Think what the problem would be like if we had to
compute the resultant vector force on every particle, at every stage
of assembly of the configuration! In this example, to be sure, the
geometrical symmetry would simplify that task; even so it would be
more complicated than the simple calculation above.

One way of writing the instruction for the sum over pairs is this:

The double-sum notation, 2 Z , says: Take 7': 1 and sum over
i=1 15%}

k = 2,3,4,...,N; thentakejz 2and sumoverk =1,3,4,...,N;
and so on, through 7' = N. Clearly this includes every pair twice, and
to correct for that we put in front the factor g.

1.6 Electrical Energy in a Crystal Lattice

These ideas have an important application in the physics of crys-
tals. We know that an ionic crystal like sodium chloride can be
described, to a very good approximation, as an arrangement of
positive ions (Na+) and negative ions (Cl") alternating in a regular
three-dimensional array or lattice. In sodium chloride the arrange-

;?
it

% p. 14
ment is that shown in Fig. 1.70. Of course the ions are not point
charges, but they are nearly spherical distributions of charge and
therefore (as we shall presently prove) the electrical forces they exert
on one another are the same as if each ion were replaced by an equivalent
point charge at its center. We show this electrically equivalent
system in Fig. 1.719. The electrostatic potential energy of the lattice
of charges plays an important role in the explanation of the stability
and cohesion of the ionic crystal. Let us see if we can estimate its
magnitude.

We seem to be faced at once with a sum that is enormous, if not
doubly infinite, for any macroscopic crystal contains 1020 atoms at
least. Will the sum converge? Now what we hope to find is the
potential energy per unit volume or mass of crystal. We confidently
expect this to be independent of the size of the crystal, on the general
argument that one end of a macroscopic crystal can have little in-
ffuence on the other. Two grams of sodium chloride ought to have
twice the potential energy of one gram, and the shape should not be
important so long as the surface atoms are a small fraction of the total
number of atoms. We would be wrong in this expectation if the crystal
were made out of ions of one sign only. Then, one gram of crystal
would carry an enormous electric charge and putting two such crystals
together to make a two-gram crystal would take a fantastic
amount of energy. (You might estimate how much!) The situation
is saved by the fact that the crystal structure is an alternation of equal
and opposite charges, so that any macroscopic bit of crystal is very
nearly neutral.

To evaluate the potential energy we first observe that every positive
ion is in a position equivalent to that of every other positive ion.
Furthermore, although it is not perhaps immediately obvious from
Fig. 1.7, the arrangement of positive ions around a negative ion is
exactly the same as the arrangement of negative ions around a positive
ion, and so on. Hence we may take one ion as a center, it matters
not which kind, sum over its interactions with all the others, and
simply multiply by the total number of ions of both kinds. This
reduces the double sum in Eq. 9, to a single sum and a factor N; we
must still apply the factor 1}; to compensate for including each pair
twice. That is, the energy of a sodium chloride lattice composed of
a total of N ions is

Taking the positive ion at the center as in Fig. 1.719, our sum runs

over all its neighbors near and far. The leading terms start out as
follows:

U=%N[__£e£+ l2e2 862  (11)

a \/§a-\/3a

The first term comes from the six nearest chlorine ions, at distance
a, the second from the twelve sodium ions on the cube edges, and so
on. It is clear, incidentally, that this series does not converge abso-
lutely; if we were so foolish as to try to sum all the positive terms
first, that sum would diverge. To evaluate such a sum, we should
arrange it so that as we proceed outward, including ever more distant
ions, we include them in groups which represent nearly neutral shells
of material. Then if the sum is broken oil", the more remote ions
which have been neglected will be such an even mixture of positive
and negative charges that we can be confident their contribution
would have been small. This is a crude way to describe what is
actually a somewhat more delicate computational problem. The
numerical evaluation of such a series is performed nowadays with an
electronic computer. The answer in this example happens to be:

U = -0.8738Ne2

(12)

Here N, the number of ions, is twice the number of NaCl molecules.

The negative sign reflects the dominance of the nearest neighbors,
and shows that work would have to be done to take the crystal apart
into ions. In other words, the electric energy helps to explain the
cohesion of the crystal. If this were the whole story, however, the
crystal would collapse, for the potential energy of the charge distribution
is obviously louiered by an overall reduction in the spacing
a. We meet here again the familiar dilemma of classica1---that
is, nonquantum---physics. No system can be in stable equilibrium,
according to classical laws, under the action of electric forces alone.
Does this make our analysis useless? Not at all. Remarkably, and
happily, in the quantum physics of crystals the electric potential
energy can still be given meaning, and can be computed very much
in the way we have learned here.

1.7 The Electric Field .

Suppose we have some arrangement of charges, q1, q2, \ldots , qN,
fixed in space, and we are interested not in the forces they exert on
one another but only in their effect on some other charge qo which
might be brought into their vicinity. We know how to calculate the
resultant force on this charge, given its position which we may specify
by the coordinates x, y, z. The force on the charge qo is:

N

F0 = Z  <13)

1:1 T0?'
where r0, is the vector from the jth charge in the system to the point
(x,y,z). The force is proportional to qo, so if we divide out qo we
obtain a vector quantity which depends only on the structure of our
original system of charges, q1, \ldots , qN and on the position of the point
(x,y,z). We call this vector function of x, y, z the electric field arising
from the ql, \ldots , qN, and use the symbol E for it. The charges
ql, \ldots , qN we call sources of the field. We may take as the definition

of the electric field E of a charge distribution, at the point (x.y,.:)

N _. _
E(x,y,z) : Z qffjgil
1:1 '0'

Fig. 1.8 illustrates the vector addition of the field of a point charge
of +2 esu to the field of a point charge of -1 esu, at a particular
point in space. In the CGS system of units, electric field strength is
expressed in dynes per unit charge, that is, dynes/esu.

So far we have nothing really new. The electric field is merely
another way of describing the system of charges; it does so by giving
the force per unit charge, in magnitude and direction, that an exploring
charge qo would experience at any point. We have to be a
little careful with that interpretation. Unless the source charges are
really immovable, the introduction of some finite charge qo may
cause the source charges to shift their positions, so that the field itself,
as defined by Eq. 14, is different. That is why we assumed fixed
charges to begin our discussion. People sometimes define the field
by requiring qo to be an "infinitesimal" test charge, letting E be the
limit of F/qo as q0\rightarrow 0. Any ffavor of rigor this may impart is illu-
sory. Remember that in the real world we have never observed a
charge smaller than e! Actually, if we take Eq. 14 as our definition
of E, without reference to a test charge, no problem arises and the
sources need not be fixed. If the introduction of a new charge

(14)

% p. 17
causes a shift in the source charges, then it has indeed brought about
a change in the electric field, and if we want to predict the force on
the new charge, we must use the new electric field in computing it.

Perhaps you still want to ask, what is an electric field? Is it something
real, or is it merely a name for a factor in an equation which has
to be multiplied by something else to give the numerical value of the
force we measure in an experiment? Two observations may be useful
here. First, since it works, it doesn't make any difference. That
is not a frivolous answer, but a serious one. Second, the fact that
the electric field vector at a point in space is all we need know to
predict the force that will act on any charge at that point is by no
means trivial. It might have been otherwise! If no experiments
had ever been done, we could imagine that in two different situations
in which unit charges experience equal force, test charges of
strength 2 units might experience different forces, depending on the
nature of the other charges in the system. If that were true, the field
description wouldn't work.

The electric field attaches to every point in a system a local prop-
erty, in this sense: If we know E in some small neighborhood, we
know, without further inquiry, what will happen to any charges in
that neighborhood. We don't need to know what produced the field.
If we know the electric field at all points in space, we have a complete
description of the whole system, one that will reveal the positions
and magnitudes of all the charges.

To visualize an electric field, you need to associate a vector, that is,
a magnitude and direction, with every point in space. We shall use
various schemes, none of them wholly satisfactory, to depict vector
fields in this book.

It is hard to draw in two dimensions a picture of a vector function
in three-dimensional space. We can indicate the magnitude and
direction of E at various points by drawing little arrows near those
points, making the arrows longer where E is larger.1' Using this
scheme, we show in Fig. 1._9a the field of an isolated point charge of
+3 units and in Fig. 1.91) the field of a point charge of - 1 unit.
These pictures admittedly add nothing whatever to our understanding
of the field of an isolated charge; anyone can imagine a simple
radial inverse-square field without the help of a picture. We show

]'Such a representation is rather clumsy at best. It is hard to indicate the point in
space to which a particular vector Value applies, and the range of magnitudes of E is

usually so large that it is impracticable to make the lengths of the arrows proportional
to E.

% p. 18
them in order to combine the two fields in Fig. 1.10, which indicates
in the same manner the field of two such charges separated by a
distance a. All that Fig. 1.10 can show is the field in a plane containing
the charges. To get a full three-dimensional representation
one must imagine the figure rotated around the symmetry axis. In
Fig. 1.10 there is one point in space where-E is zero. How far from
the nearer charge must this lie? Notice also that toward the edge of
the picture the field points more or less radically outward all around.
One can see that at a very large distance from the charges the field
will look very much like the field from a positive point charge. This
is to be expected because the separation of the charges cannot make
very much difference for points far away, and a point charge of +2
units is just what we would have left if we superimposed our two
sources at one spot.

Another way to depict a vector field is to draw field lines. These
are simply curves whose tangent, at any point, lies in the direction of
the field at that point. Such curves will be smooth and continuous
except at singularities such as point charges, or points like the one
in the example of Fig. 1.10 where the field is zero. A field line plot

% p. 19
does not directly give the magnitude of the field, although we shall
see that, in a general way, the field lines converge as we approach a
region of strong field and spread apart as we approach a region of
weak field. In Fig. 1.11 are drawn some field lines for the same arrangement
of charges as in Fig. 1.10, a positive charge of 3 units and
a negative charge of one unit. Again, we are restricted by the nature

of paper and ink to a two-dimensional section through a three-
dimensional bundle of curves.

1.8 Charge Distributions

This is as good a place as any to generalize from point charges to
continuous charge distributions. A volume distribution of charge is
described by a scalar charge-density function p, which is a function
of position, with the dimensions charge/volume. That is, p times a
volume element gives the amount of charge contained in that volume
element. The same symbol is often used for mass per unit volume,
but in this book we shall always give charge per unit volume first

% p. 21
call on the symbol p. If we write p as a function of the coordinates
x, y, 3, then p(x,y,z) dx dy dz is the charge contained in the little box,
of volume dx dy dz, located at the point (x,y,z).

On an atomic scale, of course, the charge density varies enormously
from point to point; even so/it proves to be a useful concept
in that domain. However we shall use it mainly when we are dealing
with large-scale systems, so large that a volume element do =
dx dy dz can be quite small relative to the size of our system although
still large enough to contain many atoms or elementary charges.
As we have remarked before, we face a similar problem in defining
the ordinary mass-density of a substance.

If the source of the electric field is to be a continuous charge distribution
rather than point charges, we have only to replace the sum
in Eq. 13 with the appropriate integral. The integral gives the electric
field at (x,y,z), which is produced by charges at other points
(x',y',z' .

'" p(x',y',z')i' dx' dy' dz'

E(x,y,z) =3' 12 (15)

This is a volume integral. Holding (x,y,z) fixed we let the variables
of integration x', y', and z' range over all space containing charge,
thus summing up the contributions of all the bits of charge. The
unit vector f' points from (x', y', z') to (x,y,z)-unless we want to put
a minus sign before the integral in which case we may reverse the
direction of 1'-. It is always hard to keep signs straight. Let's remember
that the electric field points away from a positive source
(Fig. 1.12).

In the neighborhood of a true point charge the electric field grows
infinite like 1/r2 as we approach the point. It makes no sense to talk
about the field at the point charge. As our ultimate physical sources
of field are not, we believe, infinite concentrations of charge in zero
volume but instead finite structures, we simply ignore the mathematical
singularities implied by our point-charge language and rule
out of bounds the interior of our elementary sources. It may be
worth noting, nevertheless, that a continuous charge distribution
contains no threat of a singularity, and allows the field to be defined
at points inside the distribution itself. That is because the volume
integral in Eq. 15 is prevented from blowing up in the neighborhood
of r = O by the fact that the volume element itself goes as r2 dr. That
is to say, so long as p remains finite, the field will remain finite every-

where, even in the interior or on the boundary of a charge
distribution.

% p. 22
1.9 Flux

The relation between the electric field and its sources can be expressed
in a remarkably simple way, one that we shall find very
useful. For this we need to define a quantity called flux.

Consider some electric field in space and in this space some arbitrary
closed surface, like a balloon of any shape. Figure 1.13 shows
such a surface, the field being suggested by a few field lines. Now
divide the whole surface into little patches which are so small that
over any one patch the surface is practically flat and the vector field
does not change appreciably from one part of a patch to another. In
other words, don't let the balloon be too crinkly, and don't let its
surface pass right through a singularity"? of the field such as a point
charge. The area of a patch has a certain magnitude in square centi-
meters, and a patch defines a unique direction---the outward-
pointing normal to its surface. (Since the surface is closed you can
tell its inside from its outside; there is no ambiguity.) Let this
magnitude and direction be represented by a vector. Then for every
patch into which the surface has been divided, such as patch number
1', we have a vector a,~ giving its area and orientation. The steps we
have just taken are pictured in Fig. 1.1312 and c. Note the vector a,-
does not depend at all on the shape of the patch; it doesn't matter
how we have divided up the surface, as long as the patches are small
enough.

Let E; be the electric field vector at the location of patch number 7'.
The scalar product E,- - a,- is a number. We call this number the flux
through that bit of surface. To understand the origin of the name,
imagine a vector function which represents the velocity of motion in
a ffuid---say in a river, where the velocity varies from one place to
another but is constant in time at any one position. Denote this
vector field by v, measured, say, in feet per second. Then if a is the
oriented area, in square feet, of a frame lowered into the water,
v - a is the rate of flow of water through the frame in cubic feet per
second (Fig. 1.14). We must emphasize that our definition of flux is
applicable to any vector function, whatever physical variable it may
represent.

1' By a singularity of the field we would ordinarily mean not only a point source where
the field approaches infinity, but any place where the field changes magnitude or direction
discontinuously, such as an infinitesimally thin layer of concentrated charge. Actu-
ally this latter, milder, kind of singularity would cause no difficulty here unless our
bal1oon's surface were to coincide with the surface of discontinuity over some finite area.

% p. 23
Now let us add up the flux through all the patches to get the flux

through the entire surface, a scalar quantity which we shall denote
by <1):

Allj

Letting the patches become smaller and more numerous without
limit, we pass from the sum in Eq. 16 to a surface integral:

<1: =f£_m E-da (17)
surface

A surface integral of any vector function F, over a surface S, means
just this: Divide S into small patches, each represented by a vector
outward, of magnitude equal to the patch area; at every patch, take
the scalar product of the patch area vector and the local F; sum all
these products, and the limit of this sum, as the patches shrink, is the
surface integral. Do not be alarmed by the prospect of having to
perform such a calculation for an awkwardly shaped surface like the

one in Fig. 1.13. The surprising property we are about to demonstrate
makes that unnecessary!

1.10 Gauss's Law

Take the simplest case imaginable; suppose the field is that of a
single isolated positive point charge q and the surface is a sphere of
radius r centered on the point charge (Fig. 1.15). What is the flux
<1) through this surface? The answer is easy because the magnitude
of E at every point on the surface is q/r2 and its direction is the same
as that of the outward normal at that point. So we have: ,

<1) = E x total area = T'; X 47"? = 4'irq (18)

The flux is independent of the size of the sphere.

% p. 24
 

Now imagine a second surface, or balloon, enclosing the first, but
not spherical, as in Fig. 1.16. We claim that the total flux through
this surface is the same as that through the sphere. To see this, look
at a cone, radiating from q, which cuts a small patch a out of the
sphere and continues on to the outer surface where it cuts out a patch
A at a distance R from the point charge. The area of the patch A is
larger than that of the patch a by two factors: first, by the ratio of the
distance squared (R/r)2; and second, owing to its inclination, by the
factor 1 /cos 0. The angle 0 is the angle between the outward normal
and the radial direction (see Fig. 1.16). The electric field in that
neighborhood is reduced from its magnitude on the sphere by the
factor (r/R)? and is still radially directed. Letting Egg) be the field
at the outer patch and Em be the field at the sphere, we have:

Flux through outer patch = Egg) - A = EWA cos 0
Flux through inner patch = Em - a = Ema (19)

E(R)A C05 0 2 l:E(¢)(%) 2:":a<£)2 1 J COS 0 : E(¢)(1

r cost?

This proves the flux through the two patches is the same.
Now every patch on the outer surface can in this way be put into
correspondence with part of the spherical surface, so the total flux

must be the same through the two surfaces. That is, the flux through _

the new surface must be just 47rq. But this was a surface of arbitrary
shape and sized' We conclude: the flux of the electric field through
any surface enclosing a point charge q is 47rq. As a corollary we can
say that the total flux through a closed surface is zero if the charge
lies outside the surface. We leave the proof of this to the reader,
along with Fig. 1.17 as a hint of one possible line of argument.
There is a way of looking at all this which makes the result seem
obvious. Imagine at q a source which emits particles---such as
bullets or photons---in all directions at a steady rate. Clearly the
flux of particles through a window of unit area will fall off with the
inverse square of the window's distance from q. Hence we can draw
an analogy between the electric field strength E and the intensity of
particle flow in bullets per unit area per unit time. It is pretty
obvious that the flux of bullets through any surface completely surrounding
q is independent of the size and shape of that surface, for
it is just the total number emitted per unit time. Correspondingly,
the flux of E through the closed surface must be independent of size

really. Besides, the sphere can be taken as small as we please.

% p. 25
and shape. The common feature responsible for this is the inverse-
square behavior of the intensity.

The situation is now ripe for superposition! Any electric field is
the sum of the fields of its individual sources. This property was
expressed in our statement, Eq. 13, of Coulomb's law. Clearly flux
is an additive quantity in the same sense, for if we have a number of
sources q1, q2, \ldots , qN, the fields of which, if each were present alone,

would be E1, E2, \ldots ,EN, the flux (I) through some surface S in the
actual field can be written

c1>:fSE-da=fS[E,+E2+...+EN]-da (20)

We have just learned that L En - da equals 47rq,, if the charge q,,
is inside S and equals zero otherwise. So every charge q inside the
surface contributes exactly 47rq to the surface integral of Eq. 20 and
all charges outside contribute nothing. We have arrived at Gauss's

law:
The flux of the electric field E through any closed
surface, that is, the integral f E - da over the surface,
equals 477 times the total charge enclosed by the (21)

surface:

fE-da=47T::q,- :4-7T pdv

 

We call the statement in the box a law because it is equivalent to
Coulomb's law and could serve equally well as the basic law of electrostatic
interactions, after charge and field have been defined.
Gauss's law and Coulomb's law are not two independent physical
laws, but the same law expressed in different ways.T

Looking back over our proof, we see that it hinged on the inverse-
square nature of the interaction and of course on additivity of inter-
actions, or superposition. Thus the theorem is applicable to any
inverse-square field in physics, for instance to the gravitational field,
as discussed in Vol. 1, Chap. 9.

It is easy to see that Gauss's law would not hold if the law of force
were, say, inverse-cube. For in that case the flux of electric field

"rThere is one difference, inconsequential here, but relevant to our later study of the
fields of moving charges. Gauss's law is obeyed by a wider class of fields than those
represented by the electrostatic field. In particular, a field that is inverse-square in r
but not spherically symmetrical can satisfy Gauss's law. In other words, Gauss's law
alone does not imply the symmetry of the field of a point source which is implicit in

% p. 26
from a point charge q through a sphere of radius R centered on the
charge would be

<1>=fE-da=%-41132:? (22)
By making the sphere large enough we could make the flux through
it as small as we pleased, while the total charge inside remained
constant.

This remarkable theorem enlarges our grasp in two ways. First,
it reveals a connection between the field and its sources that is converse
to Coulomb's law. Coulomb's law tells us how to derive the
electric field if the charges are given; with Gauss's law we can determine
how much charge is in any region if the field is known. Second,
the mathematical relation here demonstrated is a powerful analytic
tool; it can make complicated problems easy, as we shall see.

1.11 Field of a Spherical Charge Distribution

We can use Gauss's law to find the electric field of a spherically
symmetrical distribution of charge, that is, a distribution in which the
charge density p depends only on the radius from a central point.
Figure 1.18 depicts a cross section through some such distribution.
In this one the charge density is high at the center, decreases and then
rises again with increasing distance from the center, and is zero
beyond 10. What is the electric field at some point such as P1 outside
the distribution, or P2 inside it (Fig. 1.19)? If we could proceed only
from Coulomb's law, we should have to carry out an integration
which would sum the electric field vectors at P1 arising from each
elementary volume in the charge distribution. Let's try a different
approach which exploits both the symmetry of the system and
Gauss's law.

Because of the spherical symmetry, the electric field at any point
must be radially directed---no other direction is unique. Likewise,
the field magnitude E must be the same at all points on a spherical
surface S1 of radius r1, for all such points are equivalent. Call this
field magnitude E1. The flux through this surface S1 is therefore
simply 47rr12E1, and by Gauss's law this must be equal to 4'/-r times the
charge enclosed by the surface. That is, 47rr12E1 = 477 (charge inside
S1) or

charge inside S1

E1 :
1'12

123)

% p. 27
Comparing this with the field of a point charge, we see that the
field at all points on S1 is the same as if all the charge within S1 were
concentrated at the center. The same statement applies to a sphere
drawn inside the charge distribution. The field at any point on S2
is the same as if all charge within S2 were at the center, and all charge
outside S2 absent. Evidently the field inside a "hollow" spherical
charge distribution is zero (Fig. 1.20).

The same argument applied to the gravitational field would tell us
that the earth, assuming it is spherically symmetrical in its mass dis-
tribution, attracts outside bodies as if its mass were concentrated at
the center. That is a rather familiar statement. In Vol. I the fact
was proved by using the gravitational potential and an integration.
Anyone who is inclined to think the principle expresses an obvious
property of the center of mass must be reminded that the theorem
is not even true, in general, for other shapes. A perfect cube of uniform
density does not attract external bodies as if its mass were
concentrated at its geometrical center.

Newton didn't consider the theorem obvious. He needed it as the
keystone of his demonstration that the moon in its orbit around the
earth and a falling body on the earth are responding to similar forces.
The delay of nearly twenty years in the publication of Newton's
theory of gravitation was apparently due, in part at least, to the
trouble he had in proving this theorem to his satisfaction. The proof
he eventually devised and published in the Principia in 1686 (Book 1,
Sec. XII, Theorem XXXI) is a marvel of ingenuity in which, roughly
speaking, a tricky volume integration is effected without the aid of
the integral calculus as we know it. The proof is a good bit longer
than our whole preceding discussion of Gauss's law, and more
intricately reasoned. You see, with all his mathematical resourcefulness
and originality, Newton lacked Gauss's theorem---a relation

which, once it has been shown to us, seems so obvious as to be almost
trivial.

1.12 Field of a Line Charge

A long straight charged wire, if we neglect its thickness, can be
characterized by the amount of charge it carries per unit length. Let
A, measured in esu per centimeter, denote this linear charge density.
What is the electric field of such a line charge, assumed infinitely
long and with constant linear charge density A? We'll do the problem
in two ways; first by an integration starting from Coulomb's law.

 

% p. 28
To evaluate the field at the point P, shown in Fig. 1.21, we must
add up the contributions from all segments of the line charge, one of
which is indicated as a segment of length dx. The charge dq on this
element is given by dq = A dx. Having oriented our x axis along the
line charge, we may as well let the y axis pass through P, which is
r cm from the nearest point on the line. It is a good idea to take advantage
of symmetry at the outset. Obviously the electric field at
P must point in the y direction, so that E, and E2 are both zero. The

contribution of the charge dq to the y component of the electric field
at P is 2 i

dE,, =B-Zcos0 = R:

where 0 is the angle the vector field of dq makes with the y direction.
The total y component is then

E,,=fdE,=f_°:o"j_f{'2S"dx (25)

It is convenient to use 0 as the variable of integration. Since
R = r/cos 0 and dx = R d0/cos 0, the integral becomes:

 <2»
We see that the field of an infinitely long unitormly dense line charge
is proportional to the reciprocal of the distance from the line. Its
direction is of course radially outward if the line carries a positive
charge, inward if negative.

Gauss's law leads directly to the same result. Surround a segment
of the line charge with a closed circular cylinder of length L and
radius r, as in Fig. 1.22, and consider the flux through this surface.
As we have already noted, symmetry guarantees that the field is
radial, so the flux through the ends of the "tin can" is zero. The flux
through the cylindrical surface is simply the area, 27rrL, times ET, the
field at the surface. On the other hand, the charge enclosed by the
surface is just AL, so Gauss's lawdgives us 27rrLE, = 47r>\L or

1.13 Field of an Infinite Flat Sheet of Charge

Electric charge distributed smoothly in a thin sheet is called a
surface charge distribution. Consider a flat sheet infinite in extent,
with the constant surface charge density 0. The electric field on
either side of the sheet, whatever its magnitude may turn out to be,
must surely point perpendicular to the plane of the sheet; there is no
other unique direction in the system. Also because of symmetry,
the field must have the same magnitude and the opposite direction at
two points P and P' equidistant from the sheet on opposite sides.
With these facts established, Gauss's law gives us at once the field
intensity, as follows: Draw a cylinder, as in Fig. 1.23, with P on one
side and P' on the other, of cross section area A. The outward flux
is found only at the ends, so that if Ep denotes the magnitude of the
field at P, and Ep the magnitude at P', the outward flux is

AEP + AEp« = 2AEp. The charge enclosed is aA. Hence 2AEp =
47roA, or

Ep : 2770 (28)

We see that the field strength is independent of r, the distance from
the sheet. Equation 28 could have been derived more laboriously
by calculating the vector sum of the contributions to the field at P
from all the little elements of charge in the sheet.

The field of an infinitely long line charge, we found, varies inversely
as the distance from the line, while the field of an infinite sheet has
the same strength at all distances. These are simple consequences
of the fact that the field of a point charge varies as the inverse square
of the distance. If that doesn't yet seem compellingly obvious, look
at it this way: Roughly speaking, the part of the line charge that is
mainly responsible for the field at P, in Fig. 1.21, is the near part---
the charge within a distance of order of magnitude r. If we lump all
this together and forget the rest, we have a concentrated charge of
magnitude q : Ar, which ought to produce a field proportional to
q/r2, or ?\/r. In the case of the sheet, the amount of charge that is
"effective," in this sense, 'increases proportionally to r2 as we go out
from the sheet, which just offsets the 1/r2 decrease in the field from
any given element of charge.

independently. In the CGS electrical unit system, Coulomb's law itself is used
to define the unit of charge. Supposing the unit of mass had been defined
in exactly the same way, what would be your own mass, in such units?

passage of the a particle. (That assumption is valid because of the high speed
of the at particle.) Also, you will have to neglect the electric field of the electrons

has been built up to radius r. What is the total charge q, at this stage? Now
add an infinitesimal shell of thickness dr; how much work dU is done in bringing
the amount of charge in this shell in from infinity to the radius r? Now

1.10 At the beginning of the century the idea that the rest mass of the
electron might have a purely electrical origin was very attractive, especially
when the equivalence of energy and mass was revealed by special relativity.

1.20 One of the remarkable facts expressed in Coulomb's law is this: Like
charges repel exactly as strongly as unlike attract. To show that this is not a
trivial matter of definition, and to explore some of its implications, imagine a
world that differs from ours in this one respect. In that world the unit charge
is defined by the force between like charges. Two equal positive charges, 1 cm
apart, repel each other with a force of l dyne; ditto for negative charges. The
inverse---square law is obeyed, and superposition holds. But a unit positive
charge and a unit negative charge attract one another with a force of k dynes,
where k > 1. Show that one might expect to find, in that world, a situation
in which three concentrated charges all attracted one another. Is that possible
in our world? In that world, would it be necessary to generalize the notion
of quantity of charge? How about the concept of electric field? How many
dilferent measurements would you have to make, using test charges at a point
in space, to predict the force on any charged body anyone might put there?
For k < 1, describe a situation possible in that world but recognizably dilferent

Chapter 2 The Electric Potential

2.1 Line Integral of the Electric Field
Suppose that E is the field of some stationary distribution of electric
charges. Let P1 and P2 denote two positions anywhere in the

field. The line integral of E between the two given points is LTZE - ds,

taken along some path that runs from P1 to P2, as in Fig. 2.1. This
means: Divide the path into short segments, each segment being
represented by a vector connecting its ends; take the scalar product
of the path-segment vector with the field E at that place; add these
products up for the whole path. The integral as usual is to be re-

garded as the limit of this sum as the segments are made shorter and
more numerous without limit.

Let's work out a concrete example. Suppose we have an electric
field E such that E, = Ky and E,, = Kx, where K is a constant. This
happens to be a possible form for an electrostatic field. (We shall
learn presently how that can be quickly recognized.) Figure 2.2a
shows some field lines. What is the value of the line integral of E,

between point A and point C, over the particular path ABC in the
diagram? The vector which represents a path element is

ds:frdx+}'Idy (1)
and since the vector E is here
E=K(iy+§'x) (2)
the scalar product E - ds for any element of the path is
E-ds=K(ydx+xdy) (3)

Along the portion of the path from A to B, y = 2x and dy = 2 dx.
Therefore:

B
LEE-ds = KL(ydx+ xdy) = KL1(2xdx+ Zxdx)
1
: 4Kff) xdx : 2K (4)
Along the path fromB to C, y = 2 and dy = 0.
C C 2
LE-ds=KL3(ydx+xdy)=Kff2dx=2K (5)

The line integral over the path ABC is, therefore, 2K + 2K, or 4K.

% p. 37
The electric field of a point charge is directed radially and its magnitude
depends only on the radius r. If P1 and P2 are any two points
in the field of a point charge, it is pretty obvious that the line integral
of E is the same for all paths connecting these points. That follows
directly from the argument we used in Sec. 1.5, illustrated by Fig. 1.5,
for the work done when a charge is moved in a central field of force.
In fact, the only difference between the line integral of the force F on
a test charge q and the line integral of E, the field through which the
test charge is moved, is the factor q. Now any electrostatic field is
simply the superposition of the fields of certain charges, as expressed
in Eqs. 1.14 and 1.15. In any such field, therefore, the line integral
of E, the total E due to all the sources, must be path-independent:

LJPZE - ds has the same value for all paths connecting P1

(6)

     

and P2, in an electrostatic field

As an illustration, consider the line integral from A to C in Fig. 2.2c,
over the path via the point (2,0), the field E being the same as before.
Along the first portion, the x axis between the origin and x = 2, the
field is perpendicular to the path, so E - ds is zero. On the second leg,
E, = Kx = 2K, and the length of that path is 2 units. We get for the
line integral, then, 4K; the same as before. In fact, once we recognize
that the line integral must be path-independent, it seems foolish to
evaluate it for a path like ABC. Actually, we shall not often need to
compute the value of a line integral. The main purpose of the example
is to make sure you understand what the line integral means.

2.2 Potential difference and the Potential Function
Because the line integral in the electrostatic field is path-
independent, we can use it to define a scalar quantity (p21, as follows:

W

Then (p21 is the work per unit charge done in moving a positive
charge from P1 to P2 in the field E. Thus (p21 is a single-valued scalar
function of the two positions P1 and P2. We call it the electric
potential difference between the two points.

In our CGS system of units, potential difference is measured in
ergs/esu. This unit has a name of its own, the statvolt (the "stat"

% p. 38
comes from "electrostatic"). The volt is the unit of potential difference
in the MKS system'? It is equivalent to 1/299.79, approximately
1/ 300, of a statvolt. One joule (107 ergs) of work is required
to move a charge of one coulomb through a potential difference of
one volt.

Suppose we hold P1 fixed at some reference position. Then (1)21
becomes a function of P2 only, that is, a function of the spatial coordinates
x, y, z. We can write it simply q>(x,y,z), without the sub-
scripts, if we remember that its definition still involves agreement
on a reference point P1. We say that q> is the potential associated with
the vector field E. It is a scalar function of position, or a scalar field
(they mean the same thing). Its value at a point is simply a number
(in units of work per unit charge) and has no direction associated
with it. Once the vector field E is given, the potential function (p
is determined, except for an arbitrary additive constant allowed by
the arbitrariness in our choice of P1.

As an example, let us find the potential associated with the electric
field described in Fig. 2.2. It is convenient to locate P1 at the origin,
the point labeled A in Fig. 2.2. To evaluate

[E-ds (8)

from this reference point to a general point (x,y) it is easiest to use
a path like the dotted path in Fig. 2.2c:

(x, ) (x, (x )
q>(x,y> = - (0,; E-ds = - fW°'E.dx - fW;fEydy <9)

The first integral is zero, as we noted earlier, because in this field Ex
is zero along the x axis. The second integration is carried out at constant
x, and since E1, = Kx, the integral becomes

- Kx L' dy (10)
which has the value -Kxy. For this field then, the potential is
(p = -Kxy (11)

Any constant could be added to this. That would only mean that the

reference point to which zero potential is assigned had been located
somewhere else.

TLike the coulomb, ampere, and ohm, the volt was in common use as a "practical"
electrical unit long before the complete MKS system of electrical units was contrived.

% p. 39
We must be careful not to confuse the potential <p associated with
a given field E with the potential energy of a system of charges. The
potential energy of a system of charges is the total work required to
assemble it. In Eq. 1.8, for example, we expressed U, the potential
energy of the charge system in Fig. 1.6. The electric potential
<p(x,y,z) associated with the field in Fig. 1.6 would be the work per
unit charge required to bring a unit positive test charge in from infinity
to the point (x,y,z) in the field of that structure of eight charges.

2.3 Gradient of a Scalar Function

Given the electric field, we can find the electric potential function.
But we can also proceed in the other direction; from the potential we
can derive the field. It would appear from Eq. 7 that the field is in
some sense the derivative of the potential function. To make this idea
precise we introduce the gradient of a scalar function of position.
Let f(x,y,z) be some continuous, differentiable function of the co-
ordinates. With its partial derivatives af/ax, Bf/By, and Bf/Bz we
can construct at every point in space a vector, the vector whose x, y, z
components are equal to the respective partial derivatives.T This
vector we call the gradient off, written grad f, or Vf.

(12)

 

Vf is a vector that tells how the function f varies in the neighborhood
of a point. Its x component is the partial derivative off with respect
to x, a measure of the rate of change off as we move in the x direction.
The direction of the vector Vf at any point is the direction in which
one must move from that point to find the most rapid increase in the
function f. Suppose we were dealing with a function of two variables
only. x and y, so that the function could be represented by a surface
in three dimensions. Standing on that surface at some point, we see

T We remind the reader that a partial derivative with respect to x, of a function of
x. y. :. written simply Pf/Bx. means the rate of change of the function with respect to x
with the other variables y and : held constant. More precisely,

% p. 40
the surface rising in some direction, sloping downward in the opposite
direction. There is a direction in which a short step will take us
higher than a step of the same length in any other direction. The
gradient of the function is a vector in that direction of steepest ascent
and its magnitude is the slope, measured in that direction.

Figure 2.3 may help you to visualize this. Suppose some particular
function of two coordinates x and y is represented by the surface
f(x,y) sketched in Fig. 2.3a. At the location (x1,y1) the surface rises
most steeply in a direction that makes an angle of about 80° with the
positive x direction. The gradient of f(x,y), Vf, is a vector function
of x and y. Its character is suggested in Fig. 2.319 by a number of
vectors at various points in the two-dimensional space, including the
point (x1,y1). The vector function Vf defined in Eq. 12 is simply an
extension of this idea to three-dimensional space. [Be careful not to
confuse Fig. 2.3a with real three-dimensional xyz space; the third
coordinate there is the Value of the function f(x,y).]

As one example of a function in three-dimensional space, suppose
f is a function of r only where r is the distance from some fixed
point 0. On a sphere of radius r0 centered about 0, f = f(r0) is
constant. On a slightly larger sphere of radius ro + dr it is also con-
stant, with the Value f :- f(r0 + dr). If we want to make the change
from f(r0) to f(r0 + dr), the shortest step we can make is to go
radially (as from A to B) rather than from A to C, in Fig. 2.4. The
"slope" off is thus greatest in the radial direction, so Vf at any point
is a radially pointing vector. In fact Vf = 1*' (df/dr) in this case,
i- denoting, for any point, a unit vector in the radial direction.

2.4 Derivation of the Field from the Potential

It is now easy to see that the relation of the scalar function f to the
vector function Vf is the same, except for a minus sign, as the relation
of the potential (1) to the field E. Consider the Value of (p at two nearby

points, (x,y,z) and (x + dx, y + dy, z + dz). The change in (p, going
from the first point to the second, is

dcp=---dx+---dy+2(Bdz (13)
On the other hand, from the definition of (p, the change can also be

expressed as

dq): -E-ds $1 (14)

% p. 41
The infinitesimal vector displacement ds is just 1': dx + ydy + 2 dz.
Thus if we identify E with -V(p, Eqs. 13 and 14 become identical. So
the electric field is the negative of the gradient of the potential:

E = -V(p (15)

The minus sign came in because the electric field points from a region
of positive potential toward a region of negative potential, whereas
the vector Vcp is defined so that it points in the direction of increasing
Lp.

To show how this works, we go back to the example of the field in
Fig. 2.2. From the potential given by Eq. 11, (p = -Kxy, we can
recover the electric field we started with:

E=-w-mw=-@§+y%%-mw=m@+w>no

2.5 Potential of a Charge Distribution

We already know the potential that goes with a single point charge,
because we calculated the work required to bring one charge into the
neighborhood of another in Eq. 3. The potential at any point, in the
field of an isolated point charge q, is just q/r, where r is the distance
from the point in question to the source q, and where we have
assigned zero potential to points infinitely far from the source.

Superposition must work for potentials as well as fields. If we
have several sources, the potential function is simply the sum of the
potential functions that we would have for each of the sources present
alone---providing we make a consistent assignment of the zero of
potential in each case. If all the sources are contained in some finite
region, it is always possible, and usually the simplest choice, to put
zero potential at infinite distance. .If we adopt this rule, the potential
of any charge distribution can be specified by the integral:

I, /,z/ dxrd / d I
.,,(,W) 2L1] £<x_L>_r_2/_z
sources

(17)

where r is the distance from the volume element dx' dy' dz' to the
point (x,y,z), at which the potential is being evaluated (Fig. 2.5).
That is, r = [(x - x')? + (y - y')? + (z - z')2]1/2. Notice the
difference between this and the integral giving the electric field of a

% p. 42
charge distribution, Eq. 1.15. Here we have r in the denominator,
not r2, and the integral is a scalar not a vector. From the scalar po-

tential function <p(x,y,z) we can always find the electric field by taking
the negative gradient of q:, according to Eq. 15.

Potential of Two Point Charges. Consider a very simple example,
the potential of the two point charges shown in Fig. 2.6. A positive
charge of 12 esu is located 3 cm away from a negative charge, - 6 esu.
The potential at any point in space is the sum of the potentials due to
each charge alone. The potentials for some selected points in space
are given in the diagram. No vector addition is involved here, only
the algebraic addition of scalar quantities. For instance, at the point
on the far right which is 6 cm from the positive charge and 5 cm from

+612 + l56- = +0.8.
The unit here comes out esu/cm, which is the same as ergs/esu, or
statvolts. The potential approaches zero at infinite distance. It
would take 0.8 erg of work to bring a unit positive charge in from
infinity to a point where go = 0.8 statvolt. Note two of the points
shown on the diagram have q) = O. The net work done in bringing
in any charge to one of these points would be zero. You can see that
there must be an infinite number of such points, forming a surface in
space surrounding the negative charge. In fact the locus of points
with any particular value of q> is a surface, called an equipotential

surface, which would show on our two-dimensional diagram as a
curve.

the negative charge, the potential has the value

Potential of a Long Charged Wire. There is one restriction on the
use of Eq. 17: It may not work unless all sources are confined to some
finite region of space. A simple example of the difficulty that arises
with charges distributed out to infinite distance is found in the long
charged wire whose field E we studied in Sec. 1.12. If we attempt to
assign zero potential to remote points in that system, and carry out
the integration over the charge distribution indicated in Eq. 15, we
find that the integral diverges---we get an infinite result. We might
have expected trouble, because in this case "infinity," that is, all of
space very far from the region in which we wish to define a potential
function, contains not only points remote from the wire but most of
the wire itself! No such difficulty arose in finding the electric field of
the infinitely long wire, because the contributions of elements of the
line charge to the field decrease so rapidly with distance. Evidently
we had better locate the zero of potential somewhere close to home,

% p. 43
in a system which has charges distributed out to infinity. Then it is
simply a matter of calculating the difference in potential (p21, between

the general point (x,y,z) and the selected reference point, using the
fundamental relation, Eq. 7.

To see how this goes in the case of the infinitely long charged wire,
let us arbitrarily. locate the reference point P1 at a distance r1 from

the wire. Then to carry a charge from P1 to any other point P2 at
distance r2 requires the work per unit charge

(p21 : - PP2E'dS : -fr2<E)dT= -2Al.IlT2-f-ZAIIIT1 
1 7'1 1'
This shows that the electrical potential for the charged wire can be

taken as

(p = -2>\ ln r + const (19)

The constant, 2}\ ln 11 in this case, has no effect when we take --- grad (p
to get back to the field E. In this case,

(20)

2.6 Uniformly Charged Disk

Let us study, as a concrete example, the electric potential and field
around a uniformly charged disk. This is a charge distribution like
that discussed in Sec. 1.10, except that it has a limited extent. The
flat disk of radius a in Fig. 2.7 carries a positive charge spread over its
surface with the constant density a, in esu/cm2. (This is a single sheet
of charge of infinitesimal thickness, not two layers of charge, one on
each side. That is, the total charge in the system is 'rra2o.) We shall
often meet surface charge distributions in the future, especially on
metallic conductors. However the object just described is not a con-
ductor; if it were, as we shall soon see, the charge could not remain
uniformly distributed but would redistribute itself, crowding more
toward the rim of the disk. What we have is an insulating disk, like
a sheet of plastic, upon which charge has been "sprayed" so that every
square centimeter of the disk has received, and holds fixed, the same
amount of charge.

As a start, let's find the potential at some point P1 on the axis of
symmetry, which we have made the y axis. All charge elements in a
thin ring-shaped segment of the disk lie at the same distance from P1.
If 3 denotes the radius of such an annular segment and dc is its width, ,
its area is 2773 ds. The amount of charge it contains, dq, is therefore 

 

% p. 44
dq = a-27rs ds. All parts of this ring are the same distance away
from P1, namely r = My? + 82, so the contribution of the ring to the

potential at P1 is dq/r, or 27703 ds/\/y? + 32. To get the potential
due to the whole disk, we have to integrate over all such rings:

= 27ra[\W]s (21)
0

The integral happened to be an elementary one; on substituting
u = y? + 52 it takes the formfu'1/2 du. Putting in the limits, we

obtain:
<p(0,y,0) = 2710 [\/y2 + a2 - y] for y > 0 (22)

A minor point deserves a comment: The result we have written
down in Eq. 22 holds for all points on the positive y axis. It is obvious
from the physical symmetry of the system (there is no difference between
one face of the disk and the other) that the potential must have
the same value for negative and positive y, and this is reflected in
Eq. 21, where only g2 appears. But in writing Eq. 22 we made a
choice of sign in taking the square root of y2, with the consequence
that it holds only for positive y. The correct expression for y < 0 is
obtained by the other choice of root and is

<p(O,y,0) -: 277-o[ \/g2 + a2 + y] for y < 0 (23)

In view of this, we should not be surprised to find a singularity in
q>(0,y,0) at y = 0. Indeed, the function has an abrupt change of
slope there, as we see in Fig. 2.8, where we have plotted as a function
of y the potential on the axis. The potential at the center of the disk
is <p(0,0,0) = 2mm. That much work would be required to bring a
unit positive charge in from infinity, by any route, and leave it sitting
at the center of the disk.

The behavior of <p(0,y,0) for very large y is interesting. For g > a
we can approximate Eq. 22 as follows:

\/y2+a2-y:y[ 1+"-2-1]

y2
_ _0_"'..._ ~a_2
~u[~2<,2> +2, 

Hence

(p(0,y,0) : "';2" for y > a (25)

% p. 45
Now amzo is the total charge q on the disk, and Eq. 25 is just the expression
for the potential due to a point charge of this magnitude.
As we should expect, at a considerable distance from the disk (rela-
tive to its diameter), it doesn't matter much how the charge is shaped;
only the total charge matters, in first approximation. In Fig. 2.8 we
have drawn, as a dotted curve, the function 7ra2a/ y. You can see that
the axial potential function approaches its asymptotic form pretty
quickly.

It is not quite so easy to derive the potential for general points
away from the axis of symmetry, because the definite integral isn't so
simple. It proves to be something called an elliptic integral. These
functions are well-known and tabulated,T but there is no point in
pursuing here mathematical details peculiar to a special problem.
One further calculation, which is easy enough, may be instructive.
We can find the potential at a point on the very edge of the disk, such
as P2 in Fig. 2.9. '

To calculate the potential at P2, we consider the segment of a ring
centered on P2. As you can see in Fig. 2.9, the charge on this segment
is dq = a - 2r0 dr. Its contribution to the potential at P2 is
dq/r = 200 dr. From the geometry of the right triangle in Fig. 2.9,
r = 2a cos 0, so that dr = -2a sin 0 dB. This lets us use 0 as the

pendulum (Vol. 1, Chap. 7, Advanced Topic I, p. 227_).

variable of integration. If 0 ranges from 77/2 to 0, we sweep out the
whole disk. Thus:

go :f%=L':22a0(_2asinod0)

zff)"/24aa0 sin 0 d0 = 4:30 [sin 6 - 0 cos 0]" = 40a (26)
0

(You can do f 0 sin 0 d0 by parts-or look it up.)

Comparing this with 2710a, the potential at the center of the disk,
we see that, as we should expect, the potential, falls off from the center
to the edge of the disk. The electric field, therefore, must have an
outward component in the plane of the disk. That is why we remarked
earlier that the charge, if free to move, would redistribute
itself toward the rim. To put it another way, our uniformly charged
disk is not a surface of constant potential, which any conducting
surface must be unless charge is moving.T

The electric field on the symmetry axis can be computed directly
from the potential function:

d
E, = _ $8 = _ -2'n'o[\/g2 + a2 - y] (27)

giving
_ ll

(To be sure, it is not hard to compute Ey directly from the charge dis-
tribution, for points on the axis.)

As y approaches zero from the positive side, E,, approaches 2770.
On the negative y side of the disk, which we shall call the back, E
points in the other direction and its y component E1, is -2-no. This
is the same as the field of an infinite sheet of charge of density 0,
derived in Sec. 1.10. It ought to be, for at points close to the center
of the disk, the presence or absence of charge out beyond the rim
can't make much dilference. In other words, any sheet looks infinite
if viewed from close up. Indeed, E,, has the value 27m not only at the
center but all over the disk. To show this we can use Gauss's law
much as we did in Sec. 1.10, but we have to be a little careful because
the total electric field at a general point on the disk is not perpen-

'rThe fact that conducting surfaces have to be equipotentials will be discussed
thoroughly in Chap. 3.

dicular to the plane of the disk. Imagine any patch of the disk, of
area A, enclosed by a thin flat box, as indicated in Fig. 2.10. Let E,,+
denote the y component of the field immediately in front of this patch

of surface charge and Er the y component of the field behind it. The
outward flux from the box is

<1) = AE,,+ - AEV + (flux through side of box) (29)

The second term has a minus sign because the vector representing the
rear surface of the box points in the negative y direction. The flux
through the sides of the box can be made as small as we please by

flattening the box? That does not change the charge enclosed, which
remains 0A. In the limit, then, Gauss's law tells us " '

AE,,+ - AEy_ : 4770A (30)
or
E,,+ - E,,- = 47m (31)

In Eq. 31 we have a general result that holds for any surface charge
distribution, uniform or not: If a is the local density of any surface
charge layer, there is at that place an abrupt change, or discontinuity,
in the component of electric field perpendicular to the layer. The
magnitude of the change is 4770. In our problem, a is constant over
the disk. Also, because the fields on the two sides must be sym-
metrical, there being no other source of field, we must have
Ey+ = -Ey_, so that E,,+ = |E,,_| = 2770 all over the disk.

In Fig. 2.11 we show some field lines for this system and also,
plotted as dashed curves, the intersections on the yz plane of the surfaces
of constant potential. Near the center of the disk these are
lenslike surfaces, while at distances much greater than a they ap-

proach the spherical form of equipotential surfaces around a point
charge.

Figure 2.11 illustrates a general property of field lines and equipo-
tential surfaces. A field line through any point and the equipotential
surface through that point are perpendicular to one another, just as,
on a contour map of hilly terrain, the slope is steepest at right angles
to a contour of constant elevation. This must be so, because if the
field at any point had a component parallel to the equipotential surface
through that point, it would require work to move a test charge
along a constant potential surface.

'rThat is a safe statement so long as the radial electric field is not infinite. We know
that the radial field is finite almost everywhere on the disk because there is only a finite
dilference of potential between the center and the rim. In fact there is a place where
the radial field grows infinite, namely the exact rim of the disk. We'll keep our box
edge awav from there anvwav. since that marks also a discontinuitv in Em. and in a.

2.7 The Force on a Surface Charge

We can still learn something from the very simple symmetrical
charge distribution, a uniform surface charge of density a, on the
surface of a sphere of radius r0 (Fig. 2.l2a). The total charge Q is
equal to 4m02o. The potential outside the sphere is just Q/r, the
same as if the charge Q were concentrated at the center, while the
potential inside the sphere has the constant value Q/ro. The gradient
of a constant potential is zero, of course; we had already concluded
that the field inside any such hollow spherical shell of charge must
vanish. Figure 2.1222 and c shows graphically how potential (p and
field magnitude E Vary with r. We ask now, what is the force acting
on an element of the surface charge, such as a dA, owing to the repulsion
it experiences from all the other elements of charge on the
sphere. We know the electric field strength just outside the sphere:
E01,, = Q/r02 = 4770, whereas Em : 0. Which Value should we use
to calculate the force on the charge? in. ' 7-3.

The correct answer is §(Em,t + Em). One way to see this is to
imagine the surface charge, not as a layer of zero thickness, but as a
volume charge density in a layer of small but finite thickness Ar,
within which the volume charge density p is uniform, and so high that
the charge contained in any square centimeter of this sheet is o. In
other words, whatever Ar is, we fix p so that p-Ar = 0. Now it is
pretty obvious, and you can use Gauss's law to prove it if you want to,
that the electric field strength is zero on the inside surface of this
layer, and rises linearly through the layer, reaching the value 4770 on
the outer surface. (The curvature of the surface would make the
function not quite linear, but since we shall assume always that
Ar < r0 we have over this small region practically a flat slab.) The
average field strength in the slab, and hence the average force on unit
charge within the slab, is clearly §(Ei,, + Em), and in this particular
case with E", = 0 it is %E.,ut or 2770. Figures 2.13a-c show how things
change as we let the slab thickness decrease, keeping the charge per
unit area constant. Nothing spectacular happens; the field change

merely occurs in a shorter distance, and only the volume charge
densitv grows infinite.

 

% p. 50
Note that even if the charge density is not uniform through the slab,
as in Fig. 2. 13d, it makes no difference in the net change in E from one
side to the other. And it is still true that the total force on unit area
of such a slab is precisely §(Em + Em) times the total charge per unit
area, even when the change of field is not linear. Problem 1.29 suggests
a check on this in a simple special case, and Prob. 1.30 will get
you launched on a general proof, if you are interested.

Actual surface charges will of course not be found in a layer of zero
thickness and infinite volume density, so our intermediate picture is
more realistic than the limiting case. For instance, a charge on the
surface of a metal may be distributed through a layer several
tenths of a nanometer deep. The point is that as long as the layer is thin compared
to the other dimensions of the system we may treat it as a layer
of zero thickness, characterized only by its local density of charge
per unit area, for calculating all large-scale effects. On the other
hand, the actual distribution-in-depth may be important for subsurface
atomic phenomena, such as the passage of electrons from one
material to another, through an interface.

Returning to the question with which we began this section, we see
now that the force on an element of surface charge dq is 2770 - dq, and
since the amount of charge in a patch of area dA is dq = o dA, we
have for the force on the patch of area dA:

dF = 27702 4A (32)

The force per unit area is then just 27702. This is an outward force
arising from the repulsion of the charges. Naturally, if the charges
are not to ffy apart, it must be balanced by some other force, of atomic
or molecular origin and not included in our equations, which can hold
the charge carriers on the sphere.

If we were to charge a rubber balloon, the electrical repulsion we
have computed, 27702 per unit area, would tend to make the balloon
expand. Conversely, work would have to be done on the system to
shrink the diameter of such a charge distribution while keeping the
total charge constant. Suppose we want to shrink the sphere from
radius ro to radius r0 - dr, as in Fig. 2.14. Forgetting all other
forces, and reckoning the work we have to do against the electrical
forces alone, we have to apply an inward force of 277472 dynes to every
square centimeter of surface. This force acts through a distance dr,
so the work done on the system by these external forces is

dW = (47rr02)(2'n'o2) dr = 87r2o2r02 dr ' (33)

% p. 51
We can also express this in terms of the total charge Q, since
Q : 4771020:

Q2 dr

dW = zroz

(34)

2.8 Energy Associated with an Electric Field

Notice that the only result of shrinking the sphere, so far as the
electric field is concerned, is to create the field strength 47m in the
shell of space between ro - dr and r0, where the field had previously
been zero. In all other parts of space the field remains exactly as
before. This section of field has been created, one may say, at the
cost of the work dW. By comparing numbers we see that the cost

in work dW can be expressed in terms of the new volume do occupied
by field as

dW = _ do (35)

This is an instance of a general theorem which we shall not prove
now: The potential energy U of a system of charges, which is the total
work required to assemble the system, can be calculated from the electric
field itself simply by assigning an amount of energy (E2/877) do to
every volume element do and integrating over all space where there
is electric field.

U : 8? EntireE2 do 
field

E2 is a scalar quantity of course: E2 E E - E.

Thus we could compute the work required for the original assembly
of our spherical bubble of charge in Fig. 2.14 as follows: E = Q/r2,
r>ro: E =0,r<ro, so

1 ' _ 1 QOQZ . _ Q2
U:87fE2dc_87r0rT 47rr2dr_~2TO (37)
The same result is obtained, by calculating the work required to
shrink the sphere from infinite radius down to a final radius ro, using
Eq. 34 as follows:

U:£:°_Q2d' :fr°°gd1_ff (33)

2r2 0 2r2 _ 2r0

 

% p. 52
Some people like to think of this energy as "stored" in the field.
The system being conservative, that amount of energy can of course
be recovered by allowing the charges to go apart, so it is nice to think
of the energy as "being somewhere" meanwhile. Our accounting
comes out right if we think of it as stored in space with a density of
E2/87-r, in ergs/cm3. There is no harm in this, but in fact we have no
way of identifying, quite independently of anything else, the energy
stored in a particular cubic centimeter of space. Only the total
energy is physically measurable, that is, the work required to bring
the charge into some configuration, starting from some other con-
figuration. Just as the concept of electric field serves in place of
Coulomb's law to explain the behavior of electric charges, so when
we use Eq. 36 rather than Eq. 1.9 to express the total potential energy
of an electrostatic system we are merely using an alternate form of
bookkeeping. Sometimes a change of point of view, even if it is at
first only a change in bookkeeping, can stimulate new ideas and
deeper understanding. The notion of the electric field as an independent
entity will come into its own when we study the dynamical
behavior of charged matter and electromagnetic radiation.

We have been talking about potential energy and about electric
potential. Remember that these are quite different things. The potential
energy U of a stationary system of charges is the work required
to assemble it out of its parts, energy which we may think of as stored
in the assembled system. It is a single scalar quantity and a property
of the system as a whole. The electric potential cp is a function of
position in space, for a given distribution of electric charges. It is
expressed in units of ergs per esu, or statvolts. The difference between
the values of (p at two points in space is the work per unit
charge required to transport charge from one place to the other.

To emphasize the distinction between (1) and U, let us write Eq. 36
in terms of (1) rather than E. Since E = -Vq> we have

1
U=§ Au |V<p|2dv (39)
space

There is another way to calculate the stored energy. We learned
early in Chap. 1 that the energy required to assemble several discrete
point charges, ql, \ldots , q,-, \ldots , was given by Eq. 1.9:

U =  2 'W (40)

1:1 less; '1'"

% p. 53
Let's write this as follows:
1
U=32m[23ff MD

and look at the thing in brackets. Each term in that sum is the contribution
of one of the charges to the electric potential cp at the location
of q,-, so the entire sum, which we can call <p,~, is the potential at
q,- due to all other charges. In this way we can express U as: '

1
U=§Z%% on
J

Now if we have a continuous charge distribution p(x,y,z) instead of
a set of point charges, we merely replace the sum in Eq. 42 by the

integral:
U = %fp(p do (43)

Here the qualification that $\pot$ is due to all other charges is no longer
needed, for the charge element analogous to q,-, which is pdv, is
always infinitesimal. So $\pot$ in Eq. 43 is the electric potential for the

whole system, q:(x,y,z). Equation 43 is of course equivalent to
Eq. 39 and to Eq. 36.

2.9 Divergence of a Vector Function

The electric field has a definite direction and magnitude at every
point. It is a vector function of the coordinates, which we have often
indicated by writing E(x,y,z). What we are about to say can apply
to any vector function, not just to the electric field; we shall use
another symbol, F(x,y,z), as a reminder of that. In other words, we
shall talk mathematics rather than physics for a while and call F
simply a general vector function. We'll stick to three dimensions,
however.

Consider a finite volume V of some shape, the surface of which we
shall denote by S. We are already familiar with the notion of the total
flux <1) emerging from S. It is the value of the surface integral of F
extended over the whole of S:

<I>=fSF~da (44)

% p. 54
In the integrand dais the infinitesimal vector whose magnitude is the
area of a small element of S and whose direction is the outward-
pointing normal to that little patch of surface, indicated in Fig. 2150.

Now imagine dividing V into two parts by a surface, or a dia-
phragm, D that cuts through the "balloon" S, as in Fig. 2.1519.
Denote the two parts of V by V1 and V2 and, treating them as distinct
volumes, compute the surface integral over each separately. The
boundary surface S1 of V1 includes D, and so does 82. It is pretty
obvious that the sum of the two surface integrals

LIF-da1+fS2F-dag (45)

will equal the original integral over the whole surface expressed in
Eq. 44. The reason is that any given patch on D contributes with
one sign to the first integral and the same amount with opposite sign
to the second, the "outward" direction in one case being the "inward"
direction in the other. In other words, any flux out of V1, through
this surface D, is flux into V2. The rest of the surface involved is
identical to that of the original entire volume.

We can keep on subdividing until our internal partitions have
divided Vinto a large number of parts, V1, \ldots , V,~, \ldots , VN, with sur-

faces S1, \ldots , S1, \ldots , SN. No matter how far this is carried we can
still be sure that

;N1fSiF-da,:fSF-da=<I> (46)

What we are after is this: In the limit as N becomes enormous we
want to identify something which is characteristic of a particular

small region---and ultimately, of the neighborhood of a point. Now
the surface integral

Sir - da, (47)

over one of the small regions, is not such a quantity, for if we divide
everything again, so that N becomes 2N, this integral divides into two
terms, each smaller than before since their sum is constant. In other
words, as we consider smaller and smaller volumes in the same
locality, the surface integral over one such volume gets steadily
smaller. But we notice that when we divide, the volume is also
divided into two parts which sum to the original volume. This suggests
that we look at the ratio of surface integral to volume for an
element in the subdivided space:

 dai (48)

% p. 55
It seems plausible that for N large enough, that is, for sufficiently
fine-grained subdivision, we can halve the volume every time we
halve the surface integral so that we shall find that with continuing
subdivision of any particular region this ratio approaches a limit. If
so, this limit is a property characteristic of the vector function F in
that neighborhood. We call it the divergence of F, written div F.
That is, the value of div F at any point is defined as:

div F 2  - da, (49)
where V, is a volume including the point in question, and S1, over
which the surface integral is taken, is the surface of V,-. We must include
the proviso that the limit exists and is independent of our
method of subdivision. For the present we shall take that for
granted.

The meaning of div F can be expressed in this way: div F is the
flux out of V,, per unit of volume, in the limit of infinitesimal Vi. It
is a scalar quantity, obviously. It may vary from place to place, its
value at any particular location (x,y,z) being the limit of the ratio in
Eq. 49 as V, gets chopped smaller and smaller while always enclosing

the point (x,y,z). So div F is simply a scalar function of the
coordinates.

2.10 Gauss's Theorem and the Differential Form of Gauss 's Law
If we know this scalar function of position div F, we can work our

way right back to the surface integral over a large volume: We first
write Eq. 46 in this way:

N l: SF-da,-J
LF-da =:1fS'F.da,:21V,~  

In the limit N \rightarrow 00, V,-, \rightarrow,0, the term in brackets becomes the divergence
of F and the sum goes into a volume integral:

fsir-da=fVdivFdu (51)

Equation 51 is called Gauss's theorem, or the Divergence Theorem.

It holds for any vector field for which the limit involved in Eq. 49
exists.

% p. 56
Let us see what this implies for the electric field E. We have
Gauss's law which assures us that

fSE-da=4wfVpdo (52)

If the divergence theorem holds for any vector field it certainly holds
for E: '

LE-da=fVdivEdu (53)

Both Eq. 52 and Eq. 53 hold for any volume we care to choose---of

any shape, size, or location. Comparing them, we see that this can
only be true if at every point,

div E = 477p (54)

If we adopt the divergencetheorem as part of our regular mathematical
equipment from now on, we can regard Eq. 54 simply as an alternate
statement of Gauss's law. It is Gauss's law in dilferential form,

that is, stated in terms of a local relation between charge density and
electric field.

2.11 The Divergence in Cartesian Coordinates

While Eq. 49 is the fundamental definition of divergence, independent
of any system of coordinates, it is useful to know how to
calculate the divergence of a vector function when we are given its
explicit form. Suppose a vector function F is expressed as a function
of Cartesian coordinates $x$, $y$, and $z$. That means that we have three
scalar functions, F,(x,y,z), F,,(x,y,z), and Fz(x,y,z). We'll take the
region V, in the shape of a little rectangular box, with one corner at
the point (x,y,z) and sides Ax, Ag, and Az. as in Fig. 2.l6a. Whether
some other shape will yield the same limit is a question we must face
later.

Consider two opposite faces of the box, the top and bottom for
instance, which would be represented by the vectors iAx Ag and
-2 Ax Ay. The flux through these faces involves only the 3 component
of F, and the net contribution depends on the difference between
Fz at the top and F, at the bottom, or more precisely, on the
difference between the average of F, over the top face and the average
of F3 over the bottom face of the box. To the first order in small
quantities this difference is (BF,/az) Az. Figure 2.1619 will help to explain
this. The average value of F, on the bottom surface of the box,

% p. 57
if we consider only first-order variations in F2 over this small rec-
tangle, is its value at the center of the rectangle. That value is, to
first orderf in Ax and Ag,

A 8P; A a5;
Fz(x,y,:) +77' ax + 2" ay

(55)

For the average of F2 over the top face we take the value at the
center of the top face, which, again, is to first order only in the small
displacements,

Ax an AyZ)F,, an
F2 7 5: T A

(56)

The net flux out of the box through these two faces, each of which has
the area Ax Ay, is therefore

(Flux into box at bottom)

which reduces to Ax Ay Az (BF,/az). Obviously, similar statements
must apply to the other pairs of sides. That is, the net flux out ofthe
box through the sides parallel to the yz plane is Ay Az Ax (8F,/ax).
Notice that the product Ax Ay Az occurs here too. Thus the total
flux out of the little box is:

(58)

sions of the box at all, it remains as the limit when we let the box

the limit.]

Now we can begin to see why this limit is going to be independent
of the shape of the box. Obviously it is independent of the proportions
of the rectangular box, but that isn't saying much. It is easy to
see that it will be the same for any volume that we can make by sticking
together little rectangular boxes of any size and shape. Consider
the two boxes in Fig. 2.17. The sum of the flux 431 out of box 1 and
Q92 out of box 2 is not changed by removing the adjoining walls to
make one box, for whatever flux went through that plane was negative
flux for one and positive for the other. So we could have a
bizarre shape like Fig. 2.l7c without affecting the result. We leave it
to the reader to generalize further. Tilted surfaces can be taken care
of if you will first prove that the vector sum of the four surfaces of the
tetrahedron in Fig. 2.18 is zero.

We conclude that, assuming only that the functions F,, Fy, and F2
are differentiable, the limit does exist and is given by

BF, + BFI, + 8F;

dlV F : -
ax ay Eiz

(59)

If div F has a positive value at some point, we find---thinking of F
as a velocity field---a net "outflow" in that neighborhood. For in-
stance, if all three partial derivatives in Eq. 59 are positive at a
point P, we might have a vector field in that neighborhood something
like that suggested in Fig. 2.19. But the field could look quite different
and still have positive divergence, for any vector function G
such that div G = 0 could be superimposed. Thus one or two of the
three partial derivatives could be negative and we might still have
div F > 0. The divergence is a quantity that expresses only one
aspect of the spatial variation of a vector field.

Let's apply this to an electric field that is rather easy to visualize.
An infinitely long circular cylinder of radius a is filled with a distribution
of positive charge of density p. Outside the cylinder the electric
field is the same as that of a line charge on the axis. It is a radial
field with magnitude proportional to 1/r. The field inside is found
by applying Gauss's law to a cylinder of radius r < a. You can do
this as an easy problem. You will find that the field inside is directly

proportional to r, and of course it is radial also. The exact values
are:

E : 277pa2

E=27rpr forr<a

for r > a
(60)

% p. 59
Figure 2.20 is a section perpendicular to the axis of the cylinder.
Rectangular coordinates aren't the most natural choice here, but
we'll use them anyway to get some practice with Eq. 59. With
r = x/x2 + g2, the field components are expressed as follows:

E, = (i) E = 2"""2" for r > a

r x2 + y2

Inside the cylinder, div E is

We expected both results. Outside the cylinder where there is no
charge, the net flux emerging from any vo1ume---large or sma1l---is
zero, so the limit of the ratio flux/volume is certainly zero. Inside the
cylinder we get the result required by the fundamental relation Eq. 54.

2.12 The Laplacian

We have now met two scalar functions related to the electric field,
the potential function $\pot$ and the divergence, div E. In Cartesian coordinates
the relationships are expressed as:

E: -gradqo= _(,2%';3+yg-:+2a;:) (64)

8E, + aE,, + 8E2

dlV E : j
Bx Ely az

% p. 60
Equation 64 shows that the x component of E is E, = -a<p/ax.
Substituting this and the corresponding expressions for E,, and E,
into Eq. 65, we get a relation between div E and $\pot$:

divE= -div gradqp=-(i"_+ ff+ 82¢') (66)

The operation on $\pot$ which is indicated by Eq. 66 except for the minus
sign we could call "div grad," or "taking the divergence of the
gradient of \ldots ." The symbol used to represent this operation is V2,
called the Laplacian operator, or just the Laplacian. The expression

is the prescription for the Laplacian in Cartesian coordinates.

The notation V2 is explained as follows. The gradient operator is
often symbolized by V, called "del." Writing it out in Cartesian
coordinates,

(67)

If we handle this as a vector, then its square would be

V. :L' L2 52
V ax? + By? + az2 (68)

the same as the Laplacian in Cartesian coordinates. So the Lap-
lacian is often called "del-squared," and we say "del-squared tp,"
meaning "div grad cp." Warning: In other coordinate systems,
spherical polar coordinates for instance, the explicit forms of the
gradient operator and the Laplacian operator are not so simply re-
lated. It is well to remember that the fundamental definition of the
Laplacian operation is "divergence of the gradient of."

We can now express directly a local relation between the charge
density at some point and the potential function in that immediate
neighborhood. From Gauss's law in differential form, div E = 47rp,

we have
<69>

% p. 61
Equation 69, sometimes called Poisson's equation, relates the charge

density to the second derivatives of the potential. Written out in
Cartesian coordinates it is

One may regard this as the differential expression of the relationship
expressed by an integral in Eq. 17, which tells us how to find the po-

tential at a point by summing the contributions of all sources near
and farrl"

2.13 Laplace 's Equation

Wherever p = 0, that is, in all parts of space containing no electric
charge, the electric potential $\pot$ has to satisfy the equation

V2q>: 0 (71)

This is called Laplace's equation. We run into it in many branches
of physics. Indeed one might say that from a mathematical point of
view the theory of classical fields is mostly a study of the solutions of
this equation. The class of functions that satisfy Laplace's equation
are called harmonic functions. They have some remarkable prop-
erties, one of which is this: If <p(x,y,z) satisfies Laplace's equation,
then the average value of q) over the surface of any sphere (not necessarily
a small sphere) is equal to the value of $\pot$ at the center of the
sphere. We can easily prove that this must be true of the electric
potential $\pot$, in regions containing no charge. Consider a sphere S
in the field of a point charge q which lies outside the sphere, as in
Fig. 2.21. Now imagine some test charge of amount q' spread uniformly
over this sphere. The work required to bring in q' and distribute
it in this fashion would be q' times the average over the sphere
of the potential due to q. But we know this work would be the same
as if we had the test charge there first, and then brought q in from
infinity, and we know that in that case the work would be the same as
if q' were concentrated at the center of its sphere instead of being
spread over the surface. That proves the assertion for this case.

Tln fact. it can be shown that Eq. 70 is the mathematical equivalent of Eq. 17. This
means. if you apply the Laplacian operator to the integral in Eq. 17, you will come
out with -47rp. We shall not stop to show how this is done; you'll have to take our
word for it or figure out how to do it.

% p. 62
Since potentials of many sources are simply additive, it must also be
true for any system of sources lying wholly outside the sphere S.

This property of the potential is closely related to a fact that you
may find disappointing; you can't construct an electrostatic field that
will hold a charged particle in stable equilibrium in empty space.
This particular "impossibility theorem," .like others in physics, is
useful in saving fruitless speculation and elfort. Let us see why it
is true. Suppose we have an electric field in which, contrary to the
theorem, there is a point P at which a positively charged particle
would be in stable equilibrium. That means that any small displacement
of the particle from P must bring it to a place where an electric
field acts to push it back toward P. But that means that a little sphere
around P must have E pointing inward everywhere on its surface.
That contradicts Gauss's law, for there is no negative source charge
within the region. (Our charged test particle doesn't count; besides,
it's positive.) In other words, you can't have an empty region where
the electric field points all inward or all outward, and that's what you
would need for stable equilibrium. To express the same fact in terms
of the electric potential, a stable position for a charged particle must
be one where the potential q) is either lower than that at all neighboring
points (if the particle is positively charged) or higher than that
at all neighboring points (if the particle is negatively charged).
Clearly neither is possible for a function whose average value over a
sphere is always equal to its value at the center.

Of course one can have a charged particle in equilibrium in an electrostatic
field, in the sense that the force on it is zero. The point
where E = 0 in Fig. 1.10 is such a location. The position midway
between two equal positive charges is an equilibrium position for a
third charge, either positive or negative. But the equilibrium is not
stable. (Think what happens when the third charge is slightly displaced
from its equilibrium position.) It is possible, by the way,
to trap and hold stably an electrically charged particle by electric
fields that vary in time.

2.14 Distinguishing the Physics from the Mathematics

In the last few sections we have been concerned with mathematical
relations and new ways of expressing familiar facts. It may help to
sort out physics from mathematics, and law from definition, if we
try to imagine how things would be if the electric force were not a

% p. 63
pure inverse-square force but instead a force with a finite range, for
instance, a force varying like

e-}\T

(72)

1-2

Then Gauss's law in the integral form expressed in Eq. 52 would
surely fail, for by taking a very large surface enclosing some sources,
we would find a vanishingly small field on this surface. The flux
would go to zero as the surface expanded, rather than remain con-
stant. However, we could still define a field at every point in space.
We could calculate the divergence of that field, and Eq. 53, which
describes a mathematical property of any vector field, would still be
true. Is there a contradiction here? No, because Eq. 54 would also
fail. The divergence of the field would no longer be the same as the
source density. We can understand this by noting that a small
volume empty of sources could still have a net flux through it owing
to the effect of a source outside the volume, if the field has finite range.
As suggested in Fig. 2.22, more flux would enter the side near the
source than would leave the volume.

Thus we may say that Eqs. 52 and 54 express the same physical
law, the inverse-square law that Coulomb established by direct
measurement of the forces between charged bodies, while Eq. 53 is
an expression of a mathematical theorem which enables us to translate
our statement of this law from differential to integral form or
the reverse.

How can we justify these dilferential relations between source and
field in a world where electric charge is really not a smooth jelly but
is concentrated on particles whose interior we know very little about?
Actually, a statement like Eq. 69, Poisson's equation, is meaningful
on a macroscopic scale only. The charge density p is to be interpreted
as an average over some small but finite region containing
many particles. Thus the function p cannot be continuous in the
way a mathematician might prefer. When we let our region V,- shrink
down in the course of demonstrating the differential form of Gauss's
law, we know as physicists that we musn't let it shrink too far. That
is awkward perhaps, but the fact is that we make out very well with
the continuum model in large-scale electrical systems. In the atomic
world we have the elementary particles. and vacuum. Inside the
particles, even if Coulomb's law turns out to have some kind of mean-
ing, much else is going on. The vacuum, so far as electrostatics is

 

% p. 64
concerned, is ruled by Lap1ace's equation. Still, we cannot be sure
that, even in the vacuum, passage to a limit of zero size has physical
meaning.

2.15 The Curl of a Vector Function _

We developed the concept of divergence, a local property of a vector
field, by starting from the surface integral over a large closed sur-
face. In the same spirit, let us consider the line integral of some vector
field F(x,y,z), taken around a closed path, some curve C which
comes back to join itself. The curve C can be visualized as the
boundary of some surface S which spans it. A good name for the
magnitude of such a closed-path line integral is circulation; we shall
use 1' (capital gamma) as its symbol:

r=fCF-ds (73)

In the integrand ds is the element of path, an infinitesimal vector
locally tangent to C (Fig. 2.23a). There are two senses in which C
could be traversed; we have to pick one to make the direction of ds
unambiguous. Incidentally the curve C need not lie in a plane---it
can be as crooked as you like.

Now bridge C with a new path B, thus making two loops, C1 and
C2, each of which includes B as part of itself (Fig. 2.2319). Take the
line integral around each of these, in the same directional sense. It
is easy to see that the sum of the two circulations, F1 and F2, will be
the same as the original circulation around C: The reason is that the
bridge is traversed in opposite directions in the two integrations,
leaving just the contributions which made up the original line integral
around C. Further subdivision into many loops C1, \ldots , Ci, \ldots , CN
leaves the sum unchanged:

N N
LF-ds=2fCiF-ds, or r=2r, (74)
i=1 i=1

Here, too, we can continue indefinitely to subdivide, by adding
new bridges, seeking in the limit to arrive at a quantity characteristic
of the field F in a local neighborhood. When we subdivide the loops,
we make loops with smaller circulation, but also with smaller area.
So it is natural to consider the ratio of loop circulation to loop area,
just as we considered in Sec. 2.9, the ratio of flux to volume. How-
ever, things are a little different here, because the area a,- of the bit
of surface that spans a small loop C, is really a vector; a surface has

% p. 65
an orientation in space. We can't take the ratio of a scalar to a
vector! In fact, as we make smaller and smaller loops in some
neighborhood, we can arrange to have a loop oriented in any direction
we choose. (Remember, we are not committed to any particular
surface over the whole curve C.) Thus we can pass to the limit in
essentially dilferent ways and we must expect the result to reflect this.

Let us choose some particular orientation for the patch as it goes
through the last stages of subdivision. The unit vector 1': will denote
the normal to the patch, and this vector is to remain constant as the
patch surrounding a particular point P shrinks down toward zero

size. The limit of the ratio of circulation to patch area will be written
this way:

. r. . I F ' 015
l1rn -' or l1m C'
a;\rightarrow0 (L; a.\rightarrow0 0.1',

 

(75)

The rule for sign is that the direction of f1 and the sense in which C,
is traversed in the line integral shall be related by a right-hand-screw
rule, as in Fig. 2.24. The limit we obtain by this procedure is a scalar
quantity which is associated with the point P in the vector field F,
and with the direction 1'). We could pick three independent direc-
tions, such as 9:, $7, and 2, and get three different numbers. It turns
out that these three numbers can be considered the components of a
vector. We call the vector curl F. That is to say, the number we get
for the limit with 13 in a particular direction is the component, in that
direction, of the vector curl F. To state this in an equation,

F. F-ds

(curl F) 'fl = lim _' =1im'3*:-
!la\rightarrow0 (11 (11

(76)

 

For instance, the x component of curl F is obtained by choosing
1': = 22, as in Fig. 2.25. As the loop shrinks down around the point P,
we keep it in a plane perpendicular to the x axis. In general, the
vector curl F will vary from place to place. If we let the patch shrink
down around some other point, the ratio of circulation to area may
have a dillerent value, depending on the nature of the vector function
F. That is, curl F is itself a vector function of the coordinates.
Its direction at each point is normal to the plane through this point
in which the circulation is a maximum. Its magnitude is the limiting

value of circulation per unit area, in this plane, around the point in
question.

% p. 66
We have only asserted that the object defined in this way is a vector
---we haven't proved it. To deserve the name, the components as
defined must behave in all respects like vector components. Suppose
we have found certain values for the $x$, $y$, and $z$ components, according
to Eq. 76. If we then choose f1 in some fourth direction, the result
given by Eq. 76 ought to prove consistent with the other three num-
bers, because three components determine a vector uniquely. If you
want to look into this point, Problem 2.24 will suggest a way to convince
yourself that Eq. 76 truly defines a component of a vector.

2.16 Stokes' Theorem

From the circulation around an infinitesimal patch of surface we
can now work back to the circulation around the original large
loop C:

N N I',
r=fCF-ds=Er,=2a.[7f] (77)
i=1 i=1 '
In the last step we merely multiplied and divided by a,-. Now observe
what happens to the right-hand side as N is made enormous and all
the a,~'s shrink. The quantity in brackets becomes (curl F) -13,,
where fr, is the unit vector normal to the ith patch. So we have on
the right the sum, over all patches that make up the entire surface S
spanning C, of the product "patch area times normal component of
(curl F)." This is nothing but the surface integral, over S, of the
vector curl F:

N  N A
211,: 2 a,(curl F) -n, \rightarrow fs da - curl F (78)
i=1 1

i=l

We thus find that:

The relation expressed by Eq. 79 is a mathematical theorem called
Stokes' theorem. Note how it resembles Gauss's theorem, the divergence
theorem, in structure. Stokes' theorem relates the line integral
of a vector to the surface integral of the curl of the vector. Gauss's
theorem (Eq. 51) relates the surface integral of a vector to the volume
integral of the divergence of the vector. Stokes' theorem involves
a surface and the curve that bounds it. Gauss's theorem involves a
volume and the surface that encloses it.

% p. 67
2.17 The Curl in Cartesian Coordinates

Equation 76 is the fundamental definition of curl F, stated without
reference to any particular coordinate system. In this respect it
is like our fundamental definition of divergence, Eq. 49. As in that
case, we should like to know how to calculate curl F when the vector
function F (x,y,z) is explicity given. To find the rule, we carry out
the integration called for in Eq. 76, but we do it over a path of very
simple shape, one that encloses a rectangular patch of surface parallel
to the xy plane (Fig. 2.26). That is, we are taking ii = 2. In
agreement with our rule about sign, the direction of integration
around the rim must be clockwise as seen by someone looking up
in the direction of 1'). In Fig. 2.27 we look down onto the rectangle
from above.

The line integral of A around such a path depends on the variation
of A, with y and the variation of A, with x. For if A, had the same
average value along the top of the frame, in Fig. 2.27, as along the
bottom of the frame, the contribution of these two pieces of the whole
line integral would obviously cancel. A similar remark applies to
the side members. To the first order in the small quantities Ax and
Ag. the difference between the average of A, over the top segment of
path at y + Ag and its average over the bottom segment at y is

('M') Ag (80)

The argument is like the one we used with Fig. 2.1619.

Ax BA, ( at midpoint of )

A1' : AI 9 F
(x y) + 2 ax bottom of frame

(31)

Ax 8A, A 6A, (at midpoint of )

I=Az 9 *
A (xy)+ 2 {ix + y By top offrame

These are the average values referred to, to first order in the Tay1or's
expansion. It is their difference, times the length of the path segment
Ax, which determines their net contribution to the circulation. This
contribution is - Ax Ay (8A,/By). The minus sign comes in because
we are integrating toward the left at the top, so that if A, is more
positive at the top, it results in a negative contribution to the circula-
tion. The contribution from the sides is Ay Ax (BA,/Bx) and here
the sign is positive, because if A, is more positive on the right, the
result is a positive contribution to the circulation.

% p. 68
 

Thus, neglecting any higher powers of Ax and Ag, the line integral
around the whole rectangle is

LA-ds = (-Ax)(aa'/;')Ay + (Ay)(a§:")Ax
= Ax Ay (ag:" - 3;') (82)

Now Ax Ag is the magnitude of the area of the enclosed rectangle
which we have represented by a vector in the z direction. Evidently
the quantity

8A,, 8A,
ax ~ By (83)
is the limit of the ratio

as the patch shrinks to zero size. If the rectangular frame had been
oriented with its normal in the positive y direction, we would have
found the expression

for the limit of the corresponding ratio, and if the frame had been
oriented with its normal in the x direction, like the frame on the right
in Fig. 2.28, we would have obtained

aA,, aA,,

By az

(86)

Although we have considered only rectangles, our result is actually
independent of the shape of the little patch and its frame, for reasons
much the same as in the case of the integrals involved in the divergence
theorem. For instance, it is clear that we can freely join different
rectangles to form other figures, because the line integrals
along the merging sections of boundary cancel one another exactly
(Fig. 2.29).

We conclude that for any of these orientations, the limit of the
ratio of circulation to area is independent of the shape of the patch

% p. 69
 

we choose. Thus we obtain as a general formula for the components
of the vector curl F, when F is given as a function of $x$, $y$, and $z$:

You may find the following rule easier to remember than the formula
itself: Make up a determinant like this:

:2 9 2

B B B
--- - - 88
Bx By Bz ( )
F, F,, F,

Expand it according to the rule for determinants, and you will get
curl F as given by Eq. 87. Notice that the x component of curl F
depends on the rate of change of F3 in the y direction and the negative
of the rate of change of F, in the z direction, and so on.

The symbol V x, read as "del-cross," where V is interpreted as the
"vector"
2 §-x + 9% + 2 % (89)
is often used in place of the name curl. If we write V x F and follow
the rules for forming the components of a vector cross-product, we
get automatically the vector, curl F. So curl F and V x F mean the
same thing.

2.18 The Physical Meaning of the Carl

The name "cur " reminds us that a vector field with a nonzero curl
has circulation, or vorticity. Maxwell used the name rotation, and
in German a similar name is still used, abbreviated rut. Imagine
a velocity vector field G, and suppose that curl G is not zero. Then

% p. 70
the velocities in this field have something of this character: T:¢ or
l:T superimposed, perhaps, on a general flow in one direction. For
instance the velocity field of water flowing out of a bathtub generally
acquires a circulation. Its curl is not zero over most of the surface.
Something ffoating on the surface rotates as it moves along (see
Probs. 2.16 and 2.26). In the physics of ffuid flow, hydrodynamics
and aerodynamics, this concept is of central importance.

To make a "curl-meter" for an electric fie1d---at least in imagina-
tion---we could fasten positive charges to a hub by insulating spokes,
as in Fig. 2.30. Exploring an electric field with this device, we would
find, wherever curl E is not zero, a tendency for the wheel to turn
around the shaft. With a spring to restrain rotation, the amount of
twist could be used to indicate the torque, which would be proportional
to the component of the vector curl E in the direction of the
shaft. If we can find the direction of the shaft for which the torque
is maximum, and clockwise, that is the direction of the vector curl E.
(Of course, we cannot trust the curl-meter in a field which varies
greatly within the dimensions of the wheel itself.)

What can we say, in the light of all this, about the electrostatic
field E? The conclusion we can draw is a simple one: the curl-meter
will always read zero! That follows from a fact we have already
learned; namely, in the electrostatic field the line integral of E
around any closed path is zero. Just to recall why this is so, remember
that the line integral of E between any two points such as P1 and
P2 in Fig. 2.31 is independent of the path. As we bring the two points
P1 and P2 close together, the line integral over the shorter path in the

figure obviously vanishes---unless the final location is at a singularity
such as a point charge, a case we can rule out. So the line integral

must be zero over the closed loop in Fig. 2.31d. But now, if the circulation
is zero around any closed path, it follows from Stokes'
theorem that the surface integral of curl E is zero over a patch of any
size, shape, or location. But then curl E must be zero everywhere,
for if it were not zero somewhere we could devise a patch in that
neighborhood to violate the conclusion. All this leads to the simple
statement that in the electrostatic field E:

curl E : 0 (everywhere) (90)

Turning it around, one can say that Eq. 90 is a sufiicient condition for
a field to be conservative, that is, for it to be describable as the gradient
of some potential function.

This test is easy to apply. When the vector function in Fig. 2.2
was first introduced, it was said to represent a possible electrostatic

% p. 71
field. The components were specified by E, = Ky and E1, = Kx, to
which we should add E2 : O to complete the description of a field
in three-dimensional space. Calculating curl E we find:

BE BE
IE 9; = Z - jy =
(cur ) By az 0
6E, BEZ _
(curl E), _ az - ax _ 0 (91)
23E 29E
IE 2 : 1' - 'T : --- =
(cur ) ax By K K 0

This tells us that E is the gradient of some scalar potential. Inciden-
tally, this particular field E happens to have zero divergence, also:

5E, 315,, BEZ _
6x + 6g + Bz _

0 (92)

It therefore represents an electrostatic field in a charge-free region.
On the other hand, the equally simple vector function defined by
F, = Ky; F,, = -Kx; F; = 0, does not have zero curl. Instead,

(curl F): = ---2K (93)

Hence no electrostatic field could have this form. If you will sketch
roughly the form of this field you will see at once that it has
circulation.

You can develop some feeling for these aspects of vector functions
by studying the two---dimensional fields pictured in Fig. 2.32. In four
of these fields the divergence of the vector function is zero throughout
the region shown. Try to identify the four. Divergence implies
a net flux into, or out of, a neighborhood. It is easy to spot in certain
patterns. In others you may be able to see at once that the divergence
is zero. In three of the fields the curl of the vector function is
zero throughout that portion of the field which is shown. Try to
identify the three by deciding whether a line integral around any
loop would or would not be zero, in each picture. That is the essence
of curl. (After you have studied the pictures, think about these questions
before you compare your reasoning and your conclusions with
the explanation given in Fig. 2.34 on a later page.)

The curl of a vector field will prove to be a valuable tool later on
when we deal with electric and magnetic fields whose curl is not zero.
We have developed it at this point because the ideas involved are so
close to those involved in the divergence. We may say that we have
met two kinds of derivatives of a vector field. One kind, the diver-

% p. 72
% p. 73
direction, 8F,/ax, and so on. The other kind, the curl, is a sort of
"sideways derivative," involving the rate of change of F, as we move
in the y or z direction.

The relations called Gauss's theorem and Stokes' theorem are summarized
in Fig. 2.33. The connection between the scalar potential
function and the line integral of its gradient can also be looked on

as a member of this family of theorems and is included in the third
column.

Calculate the line integral of E from the point (0,0,0) to the point (x1,y1,0)
along the path which runs straight from (0,0,0) to (x1,0,0) and thence to
(x1, y1,O). Make a similar calculation for the path which runs along the other
two sides of the rectangle, via the point (0,y1,O). You ought to get the same
answer if the assertion above is true. Now you have the potential function

course, if you worked that problem, you have already proved it in another way
by finding a scalar function of which it is the gradient.) Evaluate the divergence

2.15 If A is any vector field with continuous derivatives, div (curl A) : 0
or, using the "del" notation, V - (V x A) = 0. We shall need this theorem
later. The problem now is to prove it. Here are two different ways in which
that can be done:

(a) (Uninspired straightforward calculation in a particular coordinate
system): Using the formula for V in Cartesian coordinates, work out the string
of second partial derivatives that V - (V x A) implies.

(b) (With the divergence theorem and Stokes' theorem, no coordinates are
needed): Consider the surface S in the figure, a balloon almost cut in two, which
is bounded by the closed curve C. Think about the line integral, over a curve
like C, of any vector field. Then invoke Stokes and Gauss with suitable
arguments.

2.16 Let the vector function v(x,y,z) represent the velocity at any point
in a ffuid. The ffuid is assumed incompressible, that is, it has the same density
everywhere. Note that this means that the rate of transport of matter through
any area defined by a little frame fixed in space will be proportional to v, so
if v at any point is constant in time and if matter is conserved, div v must be
zero everywhere. Why? This point is, however, only incidental; this problem
will be concerned mainly with curl v. Consider the special family of time-
independent flow patterns in which the flow is symmetrical about an axis and
v is always circumferentially directed. That is, v at any point is a vector perpendicular
to a plane containing that point and the axis. The axial symmetry
makes cylindrical polar coordinates z, r, and $\pot$ appropriate. Assume as a
further restriction that v is a function of r only. Then any flow of this type can
be described by v = tiw(r), where (3) means a unit vector perpendicular to 1'- and
to 2. Starting from the fundamental definition of curl v in terms of the line

integral around a little patch, show that for fields of this special symmetry,
curl v is given simply by

curl v =  <rv(r))

Use this to study the following special cases, corresponding to particular functions
v(r):

(a) The ffuid moves like a rigid body rotating around the axis with angular
velocity to. What is curl v in this case?

(b) The ffuid moves so that curl v = 0. Can this hold everywhere? What
is the function v(r)? Try to represent the flow in a sketch.

(c) The ffuid moves so that v(r) conforms to Kepler's law for circular
planetary motion. What is curl v? Could this be the motion in Saturn's
rings?

2.17 We stated Eq. 36 and its equivalent, Eq. 39, without proof. But Eq. 43
we may claim to have derived from scratch. So let us try to prove that Eq. 39
follows from Eq. 43. You should be able to do this with the following tools:

(a) The vector identity V- (fVf) = (Vf)2 + f V2f, which you may assume,
though it is not hard to prove.

(b) Poisson's equation.

Chapter 3 Electric Fields around Conductors

3.1 Conductors and Insulators

The earliest experimenters with electricity observed that substances
diff'ered in their power to hold the .``Electrick Vertue.'' Some
materials could be easily electrified by friction and maintained in an
electrified state; others, it seemed, could not be electrified that way,
or did not hold the ``Vertue'' if they acquired it. Experimenters of
the early eighteenth century compiled lists in which substances were
classified as ``electricks'' or ``non-electricks.'' Around 1730, the important
experiments of Stephen Gray in England showed that the
``Electrick Vertue'' could be conducted from one body to another by
horizontal string, over distances of several hundred feet, provided
that the string was itself supported from above by silk threadsfr
Once this distinction between conduction and nonconduction had
been grasped, the electricians of the day found that even a ``non-
electrick'' could be highly electrified if it was supported on glass or
suspended by silk threads. A spectacular conclusion of one of the
popular electric exhibitions of the time was likely to be the electrification
of a boy suspended by many silk threads from the rafters; his
hair stood on end and sparks could be drawn from the tip of his nose.

After the work of Gray and his contemporaries the elaborate lists
of electricks and non-electricks were seen to be, on the whole, a
division of materials into electrical insulators and electrical con-
ductors. This distinction is still one of the most striking and extreme
contrasts that nature exhibits. Common good conductors like
ordinary metals differ in their electrical conductivity from common
insulators like glass and plastics, by factors of the order of 1020. To
express it in a way the eighteenth-century experimenters like Gray
or Benjamin Franklin would have understood, a metal globe on a
metal post can lose its electrification in a millionth of a second; a
metal globe on a glass post could hold its ``Vertue'' for many years.
(To make good on the last assertion we should need to take some pre-

cautions beyond the capability of an eighteenth-century laboratory.
Can you suggest some of them?)

TThe ``pack-thread'' he used for his string was doubtless a rather poor conductor
compared to metal wire, but good enough for transferring charge in electrostatic ex-
periments. Gray found, too, that fine copper wire was a conductor, but mostly he
used the packthread for the longer distances.

% p. 81
The electrical difference between a good conductor and a good
insulator is as vast as the mechanical difference between a liquid and
a solid. That is not entirely accidental. Both properties depend on
the mobility of atomic particles: in the electric case, the mobility of
the carriers of charge, electrons or ions; in the case of the mechanical
properties, the mobility of the atoms or molecules that make up the
structure of the material. To carry the analogy a bit further, we
know of substances whose ffuidity is intermediate between that of a
solid and that of a liquid---substances such as tar or ice cream. In-
deed some substances---glass is a good example---change gradually
and continuously from a mobile liquid to a very permanent and rigid
solid with a few hundred degrees' lowering of the temperature. In
electrical conductivity, too, we find examples over the whole wide
range from ``good conductor'' to ``good insulator,'' and some substances
that can change conductivity over nearly as wide a range,
depending on conditions such as their temperature. A fascinating
and useful class of materials called semiconductors have this property
and even more curious properties.

Whether we call a material solid or liquid sometimes depends on
the time scale, and perhaps also on the scale of distances involved.
Natural asphalt seems solid enough if you hold a chunk in your hand.
Viewed geologically, it is a liquid, welling up from underground deposits
and even forming lakes. We may expect that, for somewhat
similar reasons, whether a material is to be regarded as an insulator
or a conductor will depend on the time scale of the phenomenon we
are interested in. We shall discover that for a rather simple and
general class of phenomena only the time scale provides the criterion,
not the distance magnitudes. For immediate purposes, however, we
don't even need to formulate the distinction precisely.

3.2 Conductors in the Electrostatic Field

We shall look first at electrostatic systems involving conductors.
That is, we shall be interested in the stationary state of charge and
electric field that prevails after all redistributions of charge have
taken place in the conductors. Any insulators present are assumed
to be perfect insulators. As we have already mentioned, quite
ordinary insulators come remarkably close to this idealization, so
the systems we shall discuss are not too artificial. The systems we
have in mind might be typified by some such example as this: Bring
in two charged metal spheres, insulated from one another and from

% p. 82
everything else. Fix them in positions relatively near one another.
What is the resulting electric field in the whole space surrounding
and between the spheres, and how is the charge that was on each
sphere distributed? We begin with a more general question; after
the charges have become stationary, what can we say about the electric
field inside conducting matter? '

In the static situation there is no further motion of charge. You
might be tempted to say that the electric field must then be zero
within conducting material. You might argue that if the field were
not zero, the mobile charge carriers would experience a force, would
be thereby set in motion, and thus we would not have a static situation
after all. Such an argument overlooks the possibility of other
forces which may be acting on the charge carriers, and which would
have to be counterbalanced by an electric force to bring about a
stationary state. To remind ourselves that it is physically possible
to have other than electrical forces acting on the charge carriers we
need only think of gravity. A positive ion has weight; it experiences
a steady force in a gravitational field, and so does an electron; also,
the forces they experience are not equal. This is a rather absurd ex-
ample. We know that gravitational forces are utterly negligible on
an atomic scale. There are other forces at work, however, which we
may very loosely call ``chemical.'' In a battery and in many many
other theaters of chemical reaction, including the living cell, charge
carriers sometimes move against the general electric field; they do so
because a reaction may thereby take place which yields more energy
than it costs to buck the field. One hesitates to call these forces non-
electrical, knowing as we do that the structure of atoms and molecules
and the forces between them can be explained in terms of
Coulomb's law and quantum mechanics. Still, from the viewpoint of
our classical theory of electricity, they must be treated as quite ex-
traneous. Certainly they behave very dilferently from the inverse-
square force upon which our theory is based. The general necessity
for forces that are in this sense nonelectrical was already foreshadowed
by our discovery in Chap. 2 that inverse-square forces alone
cannot make a stable, static structure.

The point is simply this: We must be prepared to find, in some
cases, unbalanced, non-Coulomb forces acting on charge carriers
inside a conducting medium. When that happens, the electrostatic
situation is attained when there is a finite electric field in the con-

ductor that just offsets the influence of the other forces, whatever
they may be.

% p. 83
Having issued this warning, however, we turn at once to the very
familiar and important case in which there is no such force to worry
about, the case of a homogeneous, isotropic conducting material.
In the interior of such a conductor, in the static case, we can state
confidently that the electric field must be zero.j' If it weren't, charges
would have to move. It follows that all regions inside the conductor,
including all points just below its surface, must be at the same po-
tential. For all we know, the potential could jump abruptly between
the inside and the outside of the conductor (see Prob. 3.21). But in
a homogeneous isotropic conductor, the only kind we are now con-
sidering, the jump would be the same everywhere on the conductor.
Outside the conductor, the electric field is not zero. The surface of
the conductor must be an equipotential surface of this field.

Imagine that we could change a material from insulator to conductor
at will. (It's not impossible---glass becomes conducting when
heated; any gas can be ionized by x rays.) In Fig. 3.1a is shown an
uncharged nonconductor in the electric field produced by two fixed
layers of charge. The electric field is the same inside the body as
outside. (A dense body such as glass would actually distort the field,
an effect we'll study in Chap. 9, but that is not important here.)
Now, in one way or another, let mobile charges (or ions) be created,
making the body a conductor. Positive ions are drawn in one direction
by the field, negative ions in the opposite direction, as indicated
in Fig. 3.119. They can go no farther than the surface of the con-
ductor. Piling up there, they begin themselves to create an electric
field inside the body which tends to cancel the original field. And
in fact the movement goes on until that original field is precisely can-
celed. The final distribution of charge at the surface, shown in
Fig. 3.1c, is such that its field and the field of the fixed external
sources combine to give zero electric field in the interior of the con-

ductor. Because this ``automatically'' happens in every conductor,

it is really only the surface of a conductor that we need to consider
when we are concerned with the external fields.

Tln speaking of the electric field inside matter, we mean an average field, averaged
over a region large compared to the details of the atomic structure. We know, of course,
that very strong fields exist in all matter, including the good conductors, if we search
on a small scale near an atomic nucleus. It was an electric field, after all, that deflected
the alpha particles that Rutherford and Geiger and Marsden shot through the gold foil
(see Vol. 1, Chap. 15, Historical Note 1). The nuclear electric field does not contribute
to the average field in matter, ordinarily, because it points in one direction on one side
of a nucleus and in the opposite direction on the other side. Just how this average field
ought to be defined, and how it could be measured, are questions we need not face now.

% p. 84
  

 

With this in mind, let us see what can be said about a system of
conductors, variously charged, in otherwise empty space. In Fig. 3.2
we see some objects. Think of them, if you like, as solid pieces of
metal. They are prevented from moving by invisible insulators---
perhaps by Stephen Gray's silk threads. The total charge of each
object, by which we mean the net excess of positive over negative
charge, is fixed because there is no way for charge to leak on or off.
We denote it by Qk, for the kth conductor. Each object can also be
characterized by a particular value $\pot$k of the electric potential function
cp. We say that conductor 2 is ``at the potential cpg.'' With a
system like the one shown, where no physical objects stretch out to
infinity, it is usually convenient to assign the potential zero to points
infinitely far away. In that case (P2 is the work per unit charge required
to bring an infinitesimal test charge in from infinity and put
it anywhere on conductor 2. (Notice, by the way, that this is just
the kind of system in which the test charge needs to be kept small, a
point raised in Sec. 1.7.)

Because the surface of a conductor in Fig. 3.2 is necessarily a surface
of constant potential, the electric field, which is -grad $\pot$, must
be perpendicular to the surface at every point on the surface. Pro-
ceeding from the interior of the conductor outward, we find at the surface
an abrupt change in the electric field; E is not zero outside the
surface, and it is zero inside. The discontinuity in E is accounted for
by the presence of a surface charge, of density a, which we can relate
directly to E by Gauss's law. We can use a flat box enclosing a patch
of surface (Fig. 3.3) like the one we used in analyzing the charged

% p. 85
disk in Sec. 2.6. Here, there is no flux through the ``bottom'' of the
box, which lies inside the conductor, and we conclude that E,, = 4770,
where E,, is the component of electric field normal to the surface. As
we have already seen, there is no other component in this case, the
field being always perpendicular to the surface. The surface charge
must account for the whole charge Qk. That is, the surface integral
of a over the whole conductor must equal Qk. In summary, we can

make the following statements about any such system of conductors,
whatever their shape and arrangement:

(1) = (pk at all points on the surface

of the kth conductor (1)

At any point just outside the conductor, E is

perpendicular to the surface, and E = 4770, (2)
where o is the local density of surface charge

Qk_Lkoda=Z17.T_ SkE-da (3)

 

Because (2) uniquely relates E to 0, the local surface charge density,
you may be tempted to think of o as the source of E. That would be
a mistake. E is the total field arising from all the charges in the
system, near and far, of which the surface charge is only a part. The
surface charge on a conductor is obliged to ``readjust itself'' until the
relation (2) is fulfilled. That the conductor presents a special case,
in contrast to other surface charge distributions, is brought out by
the comparison in Fig. 3.4.

Figure 3.5 shows the field and charge distribution for a simple
system like the one mentioned earlier. There are two conducting
spheres, a sphere of unit radius carrying a total charge +1 unit, the
other a somewhat larger sphere with total charge zero. Observe that
the surface charge density is not uniform over either of the con-
ductors. The sphere on theright, with total charge zero, has a negative
surface charge density in the region which faces the other sphere,
and a positive surface charge on the rearward portion of its surface.
The dashed curves in Fig. 3.5 indicate the equipotential surfaces, or
rather, their intersection with the plane of the figure. If we were to
go a long way out, we would find the equipotential surfaces becoming
nearly spherical, the field lines nearly radial, and the field would
begin to look very much like that of a point charge of magnitude +1,
which is the net charge on the entire system.

Figure 3.5 illustrates, at least qualitatively, all the features we
anticipated, but we have an additional reason for showing it. Simple
as the system is, the exact mathematical solution for this case cannot
be obtained in a straightforward way. Our Fig. 3.5 was constructed
from an approximate solution. In fact, the number of three-
dimensional geometrical arrangements of conductors which permit
a mathematical solution in closed form is lamentably small. One
does not learn much physics by concentrating on the solution of the
few neatly soluble examples. Let us instead try to understand the
general nature of the mathematical problem such a system presents.

% p. 88
3.3 The General Electrostatic Problem; Uniqueness Theorem

We can state the problem in terms of the potential function q),
for if $\pot$ can be found we can at once get E from it. Everywhere outside
the conductors $\pot$ has to satisfy the partial dilferential equation
we met in Chap. 2, Laplace's equation: V2<p -_- 0. Written out in
Cartesian coordinates, Laplace's equation reads,

-+-,+-=o <4)

The problem is to find a function that satisfies Eq. 4 and also meets
the specified conditions on the conducting surfaces. These conditions
might have been set in various ways. It might be that the potential
of each conductor, (pk, is fixed or known. (In a real system
the potentials may be fixed by permanent connections to batteries
or other constant-potential ``power supplies'') Then our solution
<p(x,y,z) has to assume the correct value at all points on each of the
surfaces. These surfaces in their totality bound the region in which
qa is defined, if we include a large surface ``at infinity,'' where we
require $\pot$ to approach zero. Sometimes the region of interest is
totally enclosed by a conducting surface; then, we can assign this
conductor a potential and ignore anything outside it. In either case,
we have a typical boundary-value problem, in which the value the
function has to assume on the boundary is specified for the entire
boundary.

One might, instead, have specified the total charge on each con-
ductor, Qk. (We could not specify arbitrarily all charges and po-
tentials; that would overdetermine the problem.) With the charges
specified, we have in effect fixed the value of the surface integral of
grad $\pot$ over the surface of each conductor. This gives the mathematical
problem a slightly different aspect. Or one can ``mix'' the
two kinds of boundary conditions.

A general question of some interest is this: With the boundary
conditions given in some way, does the problem have no solution,
one solution, or more than one solution? We shall not try to answer
this question in all the forms it can take, but one important case will
show how such questions can be dealt with, and will give us a useful
result. Suppose the potential of each conductor, (pk, has been
specified, together with the requirement that <p approach zero at
infinite distance, or on a conductor which encloses the system. We
shall prove that this boundary-value problem has no more than one

% p. 89
solution. It seems obvious, as a matter of physics, that it has a solu-
tion, for if we should actually arrange the conductors in the prescribed
manner, connecting them by infinitesimal wires to the proper
potentials, the system would have to settle down in some state. How-
ever, it is quite a different matter to prove mathematically that a solution
always exists and we shall not attempt it. Instead, we assume
that there is a solution <p(x,y,z) and show that it must be unique.
The argument, which is typical of such proofs, runs as follows.

Assume there is another function tl»(x,y,z) which is also a solution
meeting the same boundary conditions. Now Laplace's equation is
linear. That is, if go and 44 satisfy Eq. 4, then so does (p + '41 or any
linear combination such as clqa + cgzlx, where c1 and C2 are constants.
In particular, the difference between our two solutions, qn - ml/, must
satisfy Eq. 4. Call this function W:

W<x.y.z> = «p<x,y,z> - 4«<x,y.z> <5)

Of course, W does not satisfy the boundary conditions. In fact, at
the surface of every conductor, W is zero, because gb and $\pot$ take on
the same value, (pk, at the surface of a conductor k. Thus Wis a solution
of another electrostatic problem, one with the same conductors
but with all conductors held at zero potential. We can now assert
that if this is so, Wmust be zero at all points in space. For if it is not,
it must have either a maximum or a minimum somewhere---
remember that W is zero at infinity as well as on all the conducting
boundaries. If W has an extremum at some point P, consider a
sphere centered on that point. As we saw in Chap. 2, the average
over a sphere of a function that satisfies Laplace's equation is equal
to its value at the center. This could not be true if the center is a
maximum or minimum. Thus W cannot have a maximum or mini-
mum; it must therefore be zero everywhere. It follows that 4» = (p
everywhere, that is, there can be only one solution of Eq. 4 that
satisfies the prescribed boundary conditions.

We can now demonstrate easily another remarkable fact. In the
space inside a hollow conductor of any shape whatever, if that space
itself is empty of charge, the electric field is zero. This is true whatever
the field may be outside the conductor. We are already familiar
with the fact that the field is zero inside an isolated uniform spherical
shell of charge, just as the gravitational field inside the shell of a
hollow spherical mass is zero. The theorem we just stated is, in a

% p. 90
way, more surprising. Consider the closed metal box shown partly
cut away in Fig. 3.6. There are charges in the neighborhood of the
box, and the external field is approximately as depicted. There is a
highly nonuniform distribution of charge over the surface of the box.
Now the field everywhere in space, including the interior of the box,
is the sum of the field of this charge distribution and the fields of the
external sources. It seems hardly credible that the surface charge
has so cleverly arranged itself on the box that its field precisely cancels
the field of the external sources at every point inside the box. Yet
this must have happened, as we can prove in a few sentences.

The potential function inside the box, <p(x,y,z), must satisfy
Laplace's equation. The entire boundary of this region, namely the
box, is an equipotential, so we have (p = (pg, a constant everywhere
on the boundary. One solution is obviously (p = (pg throughout

% p. 91
the volume. But there can be only one solution, according to our
uniqueness theorem, so this is it. ``cp = constant'' implies E = 0,
because E = -grad (P.

The absence of electric field inside a conducting enclosure is useful
as well as theoretically interesting. It is the basis for electrical
shielding. For most practical purposes the enclosure does not need
to be completely tight. If the walls are perforated with small holes,
or made of metallic screen, the field will be extremely weak except
in the immediate vicinity of a hole. A metal pipe with open ends,
if it is a few diameters long, very effectively shields the space inside
that is not close to either end. We are considering only static fields

of course, but for slowly varying electrical fields these remarks still
hold.

3.4 Some Simple Systems of Conductors

In this section we shall investigate a few particularly simple arrangements
of conductors. We begin with two concentric metal
spheres, of radii R1 and R2, carrying total charges Q1 and Q2 respectively
(Fig. 3.7). This situation presents no new challenge. It is
obvious from symmetry that the charge on each sphere must be distributed
uniformly, so our example really belongs back in Chap. 1!
Outside the larger sphere the field is that of a point charge of magnitude
Q1 + Q2, so (pl, the potential of the outer sphere, is

(Q1 + Q2)
31

The potential of the inner sphere is given by

q32: + R"_&dr: Q1 +_Q_2+_Qi__Q_E

R1 R1 1'2 R1 R1 R2 R1

=g-:+g-: , (6)

(P2 is also the potential at all points inside the inner sphere. We could
have found (p2 = (Q1/R1) + (Q2/R2) by simple superposition:
Q1/R1 is the potential inside the larger sphere if it alone is present,
Q2/R2 the potential inside the inner sphere if it alone is present. If
the spheres carried equal and opposite charges, Q1 = - Q2, only the
space between them would have a nonvanishing electric field.

% p. 92
About the simplest system in which the mobility of the charges in
the conductor makes itself evident is the point charge near a conducting
plane. Suppose the xy plane is the surface of a conductor
extending off to infinity. Let's assign this plane the potential zero.
Now bring in a positive charge Q and locate it h cm above the plane
on the z axis, as in Fig. 3.8a. What sort of field and charge distribution
can we expect? We expect the positive charge Q to attract negative
charge, but we hardly expect the negative charge to pile up in an
infinitely dense concentration at the foot of the perpendicular from Q.
Why not? Also, we remember that the electric field is always perpendicular
to the surface of a conductor, at the conductor's surface.
Very near the point charge Q, on the other hand, the presence of the
conducting plane can make little difference; the field lines must start
out from Q as if they were leaving a point charge radially. So we
might expect something qualitatively like Fig. 3.819, with some of the
details still a bit uncertain. Of course the whole thing is bound to
be quite symmetrical about the z axis.

But how do we really solve the problem? The answer is, by a trick,
but a trick that is both instructive and frequently useful. We find an
easily soluble problem whose solution, or a piece of it, can be made
to fit the problem at hand. Here the easy problem is that of two equal
and opposite point charges, Q and - Q. On the plane which bisects
the line joining the two charges, the plane indicated in cross section
by the line AA in Fig. 3.80, the electric field is everywhere perpendicular
to the plane. If we make the distance of Q from the plane
agree with the distance it in our original problem, the upper half of
the field in Fig. 3.80 meets all our requirements: The field is perpendicular
to the plane of the conductor and in the neighborhood of Q
it approaches the field of a point charge.

The boundary conditions here are not quite those that figured in
our uniqueness theorem in the last section. The potential of the conductor
is fixed, but we have in the system a point charge, at which
the potential approaches infinity. We can regard the point charge
as the limiting case of a small spherical conductor on which the total
charge Q is fixed. For this ``mixed'' boundary condition---potentials
given on some surfaces, total charge on others---a uniqueness
theorem also holds. If our ``borrowed'' solution fits as well as this,
it must be the solution.

Figure 3.9 shows the final solution for the field above the plane,
with the density of the surface charge suggested. We can calculate
the field strength and direction at any point by going back to the two-

charge problem, Fig. 3.80, and using Coulomb's law. Consider a
point on the surface, a distance r from the origin. The square of its
distance from Q is r2 + h2, and the z component of the field of Q,
at this point, is -Q cos 0/(r2 + h2). The ``image charge,'' -Q,
below the plane contributes an equal z component. Thus the electric
field here is given by:

_ -2Q _ -2Q _ h _ -2Qh

This tells us the surface charge density a:

E2 = A" (8)

° = Z? 27702 + h2)3/2

The total surface charge ought to amount to -Q. Just as a check,
we could integrate over the surface and see if it is:

Total surface charge = I000 0 - 2m dr

% p. 94
The method of solution used here has traditionally been called
the method of images. One thinks of the fictitious negative charge
located a distance h below the plane of the conductor, toward which
the field lines appear to plunge, as the ``image'' of the point charge Q,
something like the virtual image behind a mirror. The electric force
which acts on the charge Q, owing to the attraction of the surface
charge, is equal to the force that a charge -Q in the image position
would cause. Note that the actual origin of this force is the surface
charge.

However, the mirror analogy is really not very close, and not very
helpful. One might better describe the method as an example of a
more general approach which could be called ``fitting the boundaries
to the solution.'' To show what we mean by this, let us look at some
of the equipotential surfaces in the field of two equal and opposite
charges shown in Fig. 3.10a. The plane was only one of these. The
others are closed surfaces, none of them quite spherical, but surfaces
we could locate by an elementary calculation if we had to. If now
we were to take any two of these surfaces, construct metal shells of
exactly that shape and similarly placed with respect to one another,
as in Fig. 3.1019, we would have already in hand the exact solution
for the electrostatic field of two such charged conductors! It would
be the corresponding piece of the two-charge field. Unfortunately,
no one is likely to come around with electrodes of precisely that
shape, looking for a method of solution, although as an approximate
solution for spheres it might attract some customers.

We could proceed to examine the equipotential surfaces of other
simple systems, looking for examples that might be more useful.
Perhaps we should call the method ``a solution in search of a
problem.'' A good example of its utility can be studied in Prob. 3.22.
The situation was well described by Maxwell: ``It appears, therefore,
that what we should naturally call the inverse problem of determining
the forms of the conductors when the expression for the potential
is given is more manageable than the direct problem of determining
the potential when the form of the conductors is given.''T

3.5 Capacitors and Capacitance

Two similar flat conducting plates are arranged parallel to one
another, separated by a distance s, as in Fig. 3.l1a. Let the area of
each plate be A and suppose that there is a charge Q on one plate
and -Q on the other. (p1 and (P2 are the values of the potential at
each of the plates. Figure 3.1 lb shows in cross section the field lines
in this system. Away from the edge, the field is very nearly uniform
in the region between the plates. Treating it as uniform, its magnitude
must be ((121 - <p2)/s. The corresponding density of the surface
charge on the inner surface of one of the plates is

% p. 96
 

If we may neglect the actual variation of E and therefore of a which
occurs principally near the edge of the plates, we can write a simple
expression for the total charge on one plate:



477$ (neglecting edge effects) (11)

We should expect Eq. 11 to be more nearly accurate the smaller
the ratio of the plate separation s to the lateral dimension of the
plates. Of course, if we were to solve exactly the electrostatic prob-
lem, edge and all, for a particular shape of plate, we could replace
Eq. 11 by an exact formula. To show how good an approximation
Eq. 11 is, there are listed in Fig. 3.12 values of the correction factor f
by which the charge Q given by Eq. 11 differs from the exact result,
in the case of two conducting disks at various separations. The
total charge is always a bit greater than Eq. 11 would predict. That
seems reasonable, as we look at Fig. 3.1112, for there is evidently an
extra concentration of charge at the edge, and even some charge on
the outer surfaces, near the edge.

We are not concerned now with the details of such corrections but
with the general properties of a two-conductor system. Our pair of
plates is one example of a common element in electrical systems, the
capacitor. A capacitor is simply two conductors close together, at
different potentials, and carrying different charges. We are interested
in the relation between the charge Q on one of the plates and

% p. 97
the potential dilference between them. For the particular system
to which Eq. 11 applies, the quotient Q/ (cpl - (P2) is A/4ws. Even
if this is only approximate, it is clear that the exact formula will depend
only on the size and geometrical arrangement of the plates.
That is, for a fixed pair of conductors, the ratio of charge to potential
difference will be a constant. We call this constant the capacitance
of the capacitor and denote it usually by C.

Q = CW1 - <P2) (12)

Thus the capacity of the parallel-plate capacitor, with edge fields
neglected, is given by

C _ A (in cm?)
_ 47715' (in cm)

(13)

In the CGS units we are using, with charge in esu and potential in
statvolts, capacitance has the dimensions of length and the unit of
capacity can simply be called the centimeter. Two plates each
100 cm? in area, and 1 mm apart, form a capacitor with a capacitance
of 100/(477) (0.1) cm, or 79.5 cm.

In the other system of units that we have to be familiar with, the
``practical'' system, electric charge is expressed in coulombs, or
ampere-seconds, and the unit of potential is the volt. Unit capacitance
in this system implies a capacitor that has one coulomb on
one of its plates when the potential difference is one volt. The unit
is called the farad. To relate the farad to the CGS unit of capac-
itance, the centimeter, remember that 1 volt = 1/300 statvolt, and
1 coulomb = 3 x 109 esu. Thus

1 coulomb _ 3 x 109 esu
lvolt - (1/300) statvolt

1 farad

11_E"_ = 9 1011 .
9 X 10 statvolt X Cm

A one-farad capacitor would be gigantic. To make it with plates
1 mm apart would require each plate to have an area of about
100 km2.T Because this is one place where the ``practical'' units

1 Of course there are more compact ways of making a capacitor of high capacitance!
You can buy a microfarad of capacitance at any electrical shop and easily carry it home.
In biological material the wall of a cell forms an electrically insulating layer separating
the interior of the cell from the external ffuid environment. This membrane behaves
electrically like a capacitance of, typically, 1 ptF/cm? of membrane area. What ``plate
separation'' does this imply? (Actually, the capacitance depends also on the dielectric
constant, that is, the electrical polarizability, of the medium between the plates. This

% p. 98
happen to come out a rather impractical size, one commonly uses
the microfarad (,uF) and the micromicrofarad (,u.uF). The latter unit,
l0'12 farads, is also called the picofarad (abbreviated pf). Notice
that it is about the same magnitude as our CGS unit of capacity, the
centimeter. The word condenser, by the way, is an older term for
capacitor.

Any pair of conductors, regardless of shape or arrangement, can
be considered a capacitor. It just happens that the parallel---plate
capacitor is a common arrangement and one for which an approximate
calculation of the capacitance is very easy. Figure 3.13 shows
two conductors, one inside the other. We can call this arrangement,
too, a capacitor. As a practical matter, some mechanical support
for the inner conductor would be needed, but that does not concern
us. Also, to convey electric charge to or from the conductors we
would need leads which are themselves conducting bodies. Since
a wire leading out from the inner body, numbered 1, necessarily
crosses the space between the conductors, it is bound to cause some
perturbation of the electric field in that space. To minimize this we
may suppose the lead wires to be extremely thin. Or we might
imagine the leads removed before the potentials are determined.

In this system we can distinguish three charges: Q1, the total
charge on the inner conductor; Q2"), the amount of charge on the
inner surface of the outer conductor; Q2") the charge on the outer
surface of the outer conductor. Observe first that Q2") must equal
-Q1. We know this because a surface such as S, in Fig. 3.13 encloses
both these charges and no others and the flux through this
surface is zero. The flux is zero because on the surface S, lying, as
it does, in the interior of a conductor, the electric field is zero.

Evidently the value of Q1 will uniquely determine the electric field
within the region between the two conductors, and thus will determine
the difference between their potentials, <p1 - (P2. For that
reason, if we are considering the two bodies as ``plates'' of a capaci-
tor, it is only Q1, or its counterpart Q2"), that is involved in determining
the capacitance. The capacitance is:

c=% (14)

Q2"), on which (P2 itself depends, is here irrelevant. In fact, the complete
enclosure of one conductor by the other makes the capacitance

% p. 99
independent of everything outside. If we were faced instead with
two unsymmetrical capacitor plates not so enclosed---something like
Fig. 3.14, say,---we might be puzzled by the question: What is the
charge which plays the role of Q1, in terms of which the capacitance
should be defined? The answer is that it is the amount of charge
that would have to be transferred from conductor 1 to conductor 2
(thus keeping the sum of the charges on the two conductors con-
stant) to cause their potentials to become equal.

3.6 Potentials and Charges on Several Conductors

We have been skirting the edge of a more general problem, the
relations among the charges and potentials of any number of conductors
of some given configuration. The two-conductor capacitor
is just a special case. It may surprise you that anything useful can
be said about the general case. In tackling it, about all we can use
is the Uniqueness Theorem and the Superposition Principle. To
have something definite in mind, consider three separate conductors,
all enclosed by a conducting shell, as in Fig. 3.15. The potential of
this shell we may choose to be zero; with respect to this reference the
potentials of the three conductors, for some particular state of the
system, are qol, «p2, and (p3. The Uniqueness Theorem guarantees
that with (p1, (P2, and (P3 given, the electric field is determined throughout
the system. It follows that the charges Q1, Q2, and Q3 on the
individual conductors are likewise uniquely determined.

We need not keep account of the charge on the inner surface of
the surrounding shell, since it will always be -(Q1 + Q2 + Q3).
If you prefer, you can let ``infinity'' take over the role of this shell,
imagining the shell to expand outward without limit. We have kept
it in the picture because it makes the process of charge transfer easier
to follow, for some people, if we have something to connect to.

Among the possible statesnof this system are ones with (P2 and (P3
both zero. We could enforce this condition by connecting conductors
2 and 3 to the zero-potential shell, as indicated in Fig. 3.l5a.
As before, we may suppose the connecting wires are so thin that any
charge residing on them is negligible. Of course, we really do not
care how the specified condition is brought about. In such a state,
which we shall call state I, the electric field in the whole system and
the charge on every conductor is determined uniquely by the value
of (pl. Moreover, if (pl were doubled that would imply a doubling

% p. 100
of the field strength everywhere, and hence a doubling of each of
the charges Q1, Q2, and Q3. That is, with (P2 = (133 = 0, each of the
three charges must be proportional to (pl. Stated mathematically:

(P2S:n::3I= 0 } Q1 = C11<P1§ Q2 = C21<Pi; Q3 = C31<P1 (15)
The three constants, C11, C21, and C31 can depend only on the shape
and arrangement of the conducting bodies.

In just the same way we could analyze states in which (p1 and (p3
are zero, calling such a condition state II (Fig. 3.151)). Again, we
must find a linear relation between the only nonzero potential, (P2 in
this case, and the various charges:

II
Sine _ 0 ] Q1 = C12<P2; Q2 = C22<P2§ Q3 = C32<P2 (16)
'P1 - 'P3 -
Finally, when (121 and (P2 are held at zero, the field and the charges
are proportional to (P32

(p1S:lt(:2H=I 0 } Q1 = C13<P3; Q2 = C23<P3§ Q3 = C33<P3 (17)

Now the superposition of three states like I, II, and III is also a
possible state. The electric field at any point is the vector sum of
the electric fields at that point in the three cases, while the charge on
a conductor is the sum of the charges it carried in the three cases.
In this new state the potentials are (p1, (p2, and (P3, none of them necessarily
zero. In short, we have a completely general state. The

relation connecting charges and potentials is obtained simply by
adding Eqs. 15 through 17:

Q1 = C11<P1 + C12<P2 + C13<P3
Q2 = C21<P1 + C22<P2 + C23<P3 (18)
Q3 = C31<P1 + C§2<P2 + C33<P3

It appears that the electrical behavior of this system is characterized
by the nine constants C11, C12, \ldots , C33. In fact only six constants
are necessary, for it can be proved that in any system
C12 = C21, C13 = C31, and C23 = C32.  this ShO11ld b6 S0 IS l'10t
obvious. Problem 3.27 will suggest a proof based on conservation

% p. 101
of energy, but for that purpose you will need an idea developed in
Sec. 3.7. The C's in Eqs. 18 are called the coefficients of capacitance.
It is clear that our argument would extend to any number of con-
ductors. Incidentally, what was defined earlier as the capacitance
of a two-plate capacitor, is not the same as C11 (or C22 or C12), but
it is of course related to them.

A set of equations like (18) can be solved for the <p's in terms of

the Q's. That is, there is an equivalent set of linear relations of the
form:

'P1 = P11Q1 + P12Q2 + P13Q3
(P2 = P21Q1 + P22Q2 + P23Q3 (19)
(P3 = P31Q1 + P32Q2 + P33Q3

The P's are called the potential coefficients; they could be computed
from the C's, or vice versa.

We have here a simple example of the kind of relation we can
expect to govern any linear physical system. Such relations turn up
in the study of mechanical structures (connecting the strains with
the loads), in the analysis of electrical circuits (connecting voltages

and currents), and generally speaking, wherever the superposition
principle can be applied.

3.7 Energy Stored in a Capacitor

Consider a capacitor of capacitance C, with a potential difference
(p12 between the plates. The charge Q is equal to C<p12. There is a
charge Q on one plate and -Q on the other. Suppose we increase
the charge from Q to Q + dQ by transporting a positive charge dQ
from the negative to the positive plate, working against the potential
difference (p12. The work that has to be done is dW = (P12 dQ -_-
Q dQ/ C. Therefore to charge the capacitor starting from the uncharged
state to some final charge Q, requires the work

_i Q! _ Q/2
W_ C Q=0QdQ_ 2C

(20)

This is the energy U which is ``stored'' in the capacitor. It can also
be expressed by

U : -%Cq)122 

% p. 102
For the parallel-plate capacitor with plate area A and separation s
we found the capacitance C = A /4773 and the electric field E = (p12/S.
Hence Eq. 21 is also equivalent to

_ L _A_ _E_2. -2.
U_ 2 (4778 )(Es)2 _ 877 As _ 8" volume (22)

This agrees with our general formula, Eq. 2.36, for the energy stored
in an electric field.T

3.8 Other Views of the Boundary-value Problem

It would be wrong to leave the impression that there are no general
methods for dealing with the Laplacian boundary-value prob-
lem. Although we cannot pursue this question much further, we
shall mention three useful and interesting approaches which you are
likely to meet in future study of physics or applied mathematics.

First, an elegant method of analysis, called conformal mapping,
is based on the theory of functions of a complex variable. Unfor-
tunately it applies only to two-dimensional systems. These are systems
in which $\pot$ depends only on x and y, for example, all conducting
boundaries being cylinders (in the general sense) with elements
running parallel to z. Laplace's equation then reduces to

with boundary values specified on some lines or curves in the xy
plane. Many systems of practical interest are like this, or sufficiently
like this to make the method useful, quite apart from its intrinsic
mathematical interest. For instance, the exact solution for the potential
around two long parallel strips is easily obtained by the
method of conformal mapping. The field lines and equipotentials
are shown in a cross-section plane in Fig. 3.16. This provides us
with the edge field for any parallel-plate capacitor in which the edge
is long compared to the gap. The field shown in Fig. 3.llb was
copied from such a solution. You will be able to apply this method

after you have studied in more advanced mathematics functions of
a complex variable.

1' All this applied to the ``vacuum capacitor'' consisting of conductors with empty space
in between. As you know from the laboratory, most capacitors used in electrical circuits

are filled with an insulator or ``dielectric.'' We are going to study the effect that has in
Chap. 9.

% p. 103
Second, we mention a numerical method for finding approximate
solutions of the electrostatic potential with given boundary values.
Surprisingly simple and almost universally applicable, this method
is based on that special property of harmonic functions with which
we are already familiar: The value of the function at a point is equal
to its average over the neighborhood of the point. In this method
the potential function <p is represented by values at an array of discrete
points only, including discrete points on the boundaries. The
values at nonboundary points are then adjusted until each value is
equal to the average of the neighboring values. In principle one
could do this by solving a large number of simultaneous equations-
as many as there are interior points. But an approximate solution

 

% p. 104
can be obtained much more simply by systematically changing each
value to agree with the average of its neighbors and repeating this
process until the changes become negligibly small. This is called
the relaxation method. The only limitation is the patience of the
computer, and that has been eliminated by high-speed computing
machines, to which this method is ideally suited. If you want to see
how it works, Probs. 3.29 and 3.30 will provide an introduction.

A third method for approximate solution of boundary-value problems
is the variational method. This involves an idea that we shall
meet in many parts of physics, ranging from Newtonian dynamics
through optics to quantum mechanics. In electrostatics the principle
turns up in the following form: We have already learned that
the total energy associated with an electrostatic field can be expressed
by

_1
U_8-fffE2dv (24)

If you worked Prob. 2.19, you found that in that very simple case
the charge on a conducting boundary of constant potential (there
consisting of the two spheres connected by a wire) distributed itself
so as to minimize the energy stored in the entire field. This happens
quite generally. That is, with any system of conductors, at various
fixed potentials, charge will flow around on each conductor until the
energy stored in the field is as small as it can be. This is almost self-
evident if we note that with every reduction of the total energy in
the field, energy becomes available to promote the flow of charge';
The reason why the surface of water in a bowl is flat is essentially
the same.

Now consider the potential function <p(x,y,z) in some region enclosed
by a number of boundaries at given potentials. The correct
<p(x,y,z), that is, the solution of V2(p = 0 which fits the given boundary
potentials, is distinguished from all other functions which fit the
boundary conditions but don't satisfy Laplace's equation, such as
z,b(x,y,z), by the fact that the stored energy is less for q> than for il.
Expressing the energy in terms of q:, as we did in Eq. 2.38,

U = _1-f|vqa|2 do (25)

877

1' In putting it this way we are thinking of the flow of charge as involving some dissipation
of energy. It usually does. If it didn't, a system not originally in equilibrium could
not get rid of its energy in order to reach the equilibrium state. What do you think would
happen in that case'?

% p. 105
We can now state the boundary-value problem in a new way,
without mentioning the Laplacian. The potential function q) is that
function which minimizes the integral of Eq. 25 as compared with any
other functions fitting the same boundary values. So one way of getting
at least an approximate solution to a given boundary-value
problem is to try a lot of functions, requiring only that they take on
the assigned values at the boundary, and pick the one that gives the
lowest value for U. Or we could try a function with an adjustable
parameter or two, and turn these mathematical ``knobs'' to minimize
U. The method is especially good for estimating the energy
itself, often the most important unknown quantity. Since U is a
minimum for the correct (p, it is very insensitive to departures from
correctness in qo. Problem 3.32 will show the simplicity and accuracy
of the variational method.

More significant to us than its utility in calculations is the fact that
this variational principle represents an alternative formulation of the
basic law of the electrostatic field. The reformulation of physical
laws as variational principles has often proved to be a fruitful and
enlightening enterprise. Professor R. P. Feynman, known for his
own brilliant work along such lines, has given a lively elementary
exposition of variational ideas in one chapter of the book The Feyn-

man Lectures in Physics, vol. II, chap. 19 (Addison-Wesley, Reading,
Mass., 1964).

Problems

3.1 An observer with a device for measuring the electric field E is located
some distance away from a fixed point charge q. A short length of uncharged
metal pipe is lowered by an insulating rope until it surrounds the point charge.
How does this affect the electric field measured by the distant observer?

Explain. If you occupy a laboratory inside a large copper box, can you tell
whether charges are being moved around outside? Explain.

3.2 A spherical conductor A contains two spherical cavities. The total
charge on the conductor itself is zero. However, there is a point charge qb
at the center of one cavity and qc at the center of the other. A considerable
distance r away is another charge qd. What force acts on each of the four
objects, A, qb, qc, qd? Which answers, if any, are only approximate, and depend
on r being relatively large?

 

% p. 106
 

3.3 Suppose that after the condition shown in Fig. 3.1c is attained, the
body is made nonconducting again, leaving the charges frozen in place. After
this, the sheets of positive and negative charge which produced the original
electric field are removed. What does the residual electric field look like, both
inside and outside the body?

3.4 A cliché of science fiction, and the dream of many a scientifically
illiterate inventor, is the gravity screen, something that will ``block'' gravity
the way a metal sheet seems to ``block'' the electric field. Think about the
difference between gravitational source and electrical sources. Note that the
walls of the box in Fig. 3.6 do not block the field of the outside sources, but
merely allow the surface charges to set up a compensating field. Why can't
something of the sort be contrived for gravity? What would you need to
accomplish it?

3.5 In the field of the point charge over the plane, Fig. 3.9, if you follow
a field line that starts out from the point charge in a horizontal direction, that
is, parallel to the plane, where does it meet the surface of the conductor?
(You'll need Gauss's law and a simple integration.)

3.6 By solving the problem of the point charge and the plane conductor
we have, in effect, solved every problem that can be constructed from it by
superposition. For instance, suppose we have a straight wire, uniformly
charged with 103 esu per centimeter of length, running parallel to the earth
at a height of 5 meters. What is the field strength at the surface of the earth,
immediately below the wire? What is the electrical force acting on the wire
per unit of length? Can you think of any other simple electrostatic configurations
that can be constructed from these elements?

3.7 A charge Q is located h cm above a conducting plane, just as in Fig. 3.8a.
Asked to predict the amount of work that would have to be done to move this
charge out to infinite distance from the plane, one student says that it is the
same as the work required to separate to infinite distance two charges Q and
---Q which are initially 2h cm apart, hence W : Q2/2h. Another student
calculates the force that acts on the charge as it is being moved and integrates
F dx, but gets a dilferent answer. What did the second student get, and who
is right?

3.8 Three conducting plates are placed parallel to one another as shown.
The outer plates are connected by a wire. The inner plate is isolated and
carries a charge amounting to 10 esu/cm? of plate. In what proportion must
this charge divide itself into a surface charge 01 on one face of the inner plate
and a surface charge 02 on the other side of the same plate?

of a square, with like charges diagonally opposite one another. Show that
there are two equipotential surfaces that are planes. In this way obtain, and
sketch qualitatively, the field of a single point charge located symmetrically
in the inside corner formed by bending a metal sheet through a right angle.
What configurations of planes and point charge can be solved this way and
what can't? How about a point charge located on the bisector of a 120° dihe-
dral angle between two conducting planes?

3.10 A thin piece of metal is placed between the plates of a parallel-plate
capacitor and parallel to both plates. How does it affect the capacitance?
What if it is attached by a wire to one plate?

3.11 A 100-pF capacitor is charged to 100 volts. After the charging battery
is disconnected. the capacitor is connected in parallel to another capacitor.
If the final voltage is 30 volts, what is the capacitance of the second capacitor.
How much energy was lost, and what happened to it?

3.12 What is the capacitance C of a capacitor that consists of two concentric
spherical shells, the inner of radius r1, the outer of radius 1'2? Check your
result by relating to the case of a flat parallel-plate capacitor the limiting case
in which r2 - r1 < r1.

3.13 Let (1)12 be the potential difference between the plates of the spherical
capacitor of the preceding problem. Find an expression for the electric field,
as a function of radius. Calculate the total field energy, f(E2/877) do, and show
that it comes out equal to -§C<p122.

3.14 By the capacitance of a single isolated conductor we mean the ratio
of the charge on the conductor to its potential, taking the zero of potential
at infinite distance away. Show that the capacitance of a spherical conductor,
in centimeters, is exactly equal to the radius of the sphere. What is the capacitance
of the earth, in microfarads?

3.15 Imagine that a spherical capacitor like the one described in Prob. 3.12
is orbiting the earth as a satellite. There is no mechanical connection between
the inner and outer shells. The vacuum is essentially perfect, and the drag
on the outer sphere is negligible. In other words, we have a perfect ``zero-g''
situation. Suppose the inner sphere has some net charge and happens to be
centrally located with respect to the outer. Is this a stable situation? (Con-
sider how the energy of the system changes if the inner sphere is moved off
center. To predict the sign of the change, you might consider how the capacitance
would change if you brought the inner sphere very close to the outer
sphere.)

3.16 Calculate the force which acts on one plate of a parallel-plate capac-
itor. The potential dilference between the plates is 10 statvolts and the plates
are squares 20 cm on a side with a separation of 3 cm. If the plates are insulated
so the charge cannot change, how much external work could be done

by letting the plates come together? Does this equal the energy that was
initially stored in the electric field?

3.17 Two parallel plates are connected by a wire so that they remain at
the same potential. Let one plate coincide with the xz plane and the other
with the plane y = s. The distance s between the plates is much smaller than
the lateral dimensions of the plates. A point charge Q is located between the
plates at y = b (see figure). What is the magnitude of the total surface charge
on the inner surface of each plate? The total surface charge on the inner surface
of both plates must of course be -Q (why?), and we can guess that a
larger fraction of it will be found on the nearer -plate. If the charge were very
close to the left plate, 12 < s, the presence of the plate on the right couldn't
make much difference. However, we want to know exactly how the charge
divides. If you try to exploit the ``image'' method, you will discover that you
need an infinite chain of images extending in both directions, rather like the
images you see in a barber shop with mirrors on both walls. It is not easy to
calculate the resultant field at any point on one of the surfaces. Nevertheless
the question we asked can be answered by a very simple calculation based on
superposition. (Hint: The following remarks should give you a strong enough
clue. Adding another charge Q anywhere on the plane y = b will just double
the surface charge on each plate; in fact the total surface charge induced by
any number of charges on this plane is independent of their position on the
plane. If only we had a sheet of uniform charge on this plane the electric fields

would be simple, and we might find a way to use Gauss's law. Take it from
there.)

Chapter 4 Electric Currents

4.1 Charge Transport and Current Density

Electric currents are caused by the motion of charge carriers. The
electric current in a wire is a measure of the amount of charge passing
any point of the wire per unit time. In the units we have been
using, current would be expressed in esu per second. The practical
unit is the ampere, which amounts to one coulomb of charge per
second. A current of one ampere is the same as a current of
3 X 109 esu/ sec, which is equivalent to 6.2 x 1013 electrons per
second. Of course, it is always the net charge transport that counts,
with due regard to sign. The motion of a neutral body could be said
to involve the transport of a tremendous amount of charge (some
105 coulombs per gram of matter!), but there is no current because
exactly the same number of positive and of negative elementary
particles are moving with exactly the same average velocity.

A more general kind of current, or charge transport, involves
charge carriers moving around in a three-dimensional volume. To
describe this we need the concept of current density. We have to
consider average quantities, for charge carriers are discrete particles.
We must suppose, as we did in defining the charge density p, that
our scale of distances is such that any small region we wish to average
over contains very many particles of any class we are concerned
with.

Consider first a special situation in which there are 11 particles
per cubic centimeter, on the average, all moving with the same vector
velocity u and carrying the same charge q. Imagine a small frame
of area a fixed in some orientation, as in Fig. 4.1a. How many particles
pass through the frame in a time interval At? If At begins the
instant shown m Fig. 4.1a and b, the particles destined to pass
through the frame in the next At sec will be just those now located
within the oblique prism in Fig. 4.11). This prism has the frame area
of its base and an edge length a At, which is the distance any particle
will travel in a time At. Particles outside this prism will either miss
the window or fail to reach it. The volume of the prism is the product
base X altitude, or au At cos 0, which can be written a - u At. On
the average, the number of particles found in such a volume will be
na - u At. Hence the average rate at which charge is passing through

110

% p. 111
the frame, that is, the current through the frame which we shall call
1(a), is

I(a)= =ma-u (1)

Suppose we had many classes of particles in the swarm, differing
in charge, in velocity vector, or in both. Each would make its own
contribution to the current through a. Denoting each kind by a subscript
k, the kth class has charge qk on each particle, moves with
velocity vector uk, and is present with an average population density

of nk such particles per cubic centimeter, and we could state this in a
formal way:

1(a) = n1q1a'u1 +n2q2a°u2 +  =a-Enkqkuk (2)
k

The vector quantity in Eq. 2 that multiplies a we call the current
density J. J could be expressed in units of esu per second per square
centimeter. If we are using practical units with the coulomb as the

unit of charge, the current density will be expressed in amperes per
square centimeter.

J -: Enkqkuk 

Let's look at the contribution to the current density from one
variety of charge carriers, electrons say, which may be present with
many different velocities. In a conductor, the electrons will have
an almost random distribution of velocities, varying widely in direction
and magnitude. Let Ne be the total number of electrons per
unit volume, of all velocities. We can divide the electrons into many
groups, each of which contains electrons with nearly the same speed
and direction. The average velocity of all the electrons, like any
average, would then be calculated by summing over the groups,

weighting each velocity by the number in the group, and dividing by
the total number. That is,

_ 1
= - 4
11 Ne gnkllk ( )

We use the bar over the top of u to mean the average over a distri-
bution. Comparing Eq. 4 with Eq. 3, we see that the contribution
of the electrons to the current density can be written simply in terms
of the average electron velocity. Remembering that for the electron

% p. 112
q -_- -e, and using subscript e to show that all quantities refer to
this one type of charge carrier, we can write

J9 = ---eNefie (5)

This may seem rather obvious, but we have gone through it step
by step to make clear that the current through the frame depends
only on the average velocity of the carriers, which often is only a tiny
fraction, in magnitude, of their random speeds. Don't forget that
Eq. 4 describes a vector average; it will be zero for a distribution of

velocities in which all directions are equally likely, whatever the
speeds may be.

4.2 Stationary Currents
The current carried by a long conductor like a wire is, of course,
just the integral of the current density J over the cross section of the

wire. Indeed, the current I flowing through any surface S is just the
surface integral

1=fSJ-da (6)

I is the ``flux'' associated with the vector J, and in this case the name
is apt.

We speak of a steady or stationary current system when the current
density vector J remains constant in time everywhere. Steady
currents have to obey the law of charge conservation. Consider
some region of space completely enclosed by the balloonlike surface
S. The surface integral of J over all of S gives the rate at which
charge is leaving the volume enclosed. It will be positive if positive
charge carriers are moving outward or negative charge carriers are
moving inward, and so on. Were this to go on indefinitely, the volume
would sooner or later run out of charge---unless some new
charge were created. But charge creation is just what can't happen.
Therefore, for a truly time-independent current distribution, the
surface integral of J over any closed surface must be zero. This is
completely equivalent to the statement that, at every point in space:

div J = 0 (time-independent charge distribution) (7)

To appreciate the equivalence, recall Gauss's theorem and our fundamental
definition of divergence in terms of the surface integral
over a small surface enclosing the location in question.

% p. 113
We can make a more general statement than Eq. 7. Suppose the
current is not steady, J being a function of t as well as of $x$, $y$, and $z$.

Then since fs J -da is the instantaneous rate at which charge is
leaving the enclosed volume, while fv p do is the total charge inside

the volume at any instant, we have

ISJ-da=-%fVpdv (8)

Letting the volume in question shrink down around any point
(x,y,z), the relation expressed in Eq. 8 becomeszf

div J = _ % (time-dependent charge distribution) (9)

The time derivative of the charge density p is written as a partial
derivative since p will usually be a function of spatial coordinates as
well as time. Equations 8 and 9 express the conservation of charge:
No charge can flow away from a place without diminishing the
amount of charge that is there.

An instructive example of a stationary current distribution occurs
in the plane diode, a two-electrode vacuum tube. One electrode, the
cathode, is coated with a material that emits electrons copiously
when heated. The other electrode, the anode, is simply a metal plate.
By means of a battery the anode is maintained at a positive potential
with respect to the cathode. Electrons emerge from this hot
cathode with very low velocities, but are then accelerated toward the
positive anode by the electric field between cathode and anode. In
the space between the cathode and anode the electric current consists
of these moving electrons. The circuit is completed by the flow
of electrons in external wires, possibly by the movement of ions in
a battery, and so on, with which we are not here concerned. In this
diode, the local density of charge in any region, p, is simply -ne
where n is the local density of electrons, in electrons/cm3. The local
current density J is of course pv where v is the velocity of electrons
in that region. In the plane-parallel diode we may assume J has no
y or z components (Fig. 4.2). If conditions are steady, it follows

1' If the step between Eqs. 8 and 9 is not obvious, look back at our fundamental definition
of divergence in Chap. 2. As the volume shrinks, we can eventually take p outside
the volume integral on the right. The volume integral is to be carried out at one instant
of time. Its time derivative thus depends on the difference between the volume integral
at t and at t + dt. The only difference is due to the change of p there, since the boundary
of the volume remains in the same place.

 

% p. 114
then that J, must be independent of x, for if div J = 0 as Eq. 7 says.
(BJ,/ax) must be zero if J,, = J; = 0. This is belaboring the obvi-
ous; if we have a steady stream of electrons moving in the x direction
only, the same number per second have to cross any intermediate
plane between cathode and anode. We conclude that pv is constant.
But observe that v is not constant; it varies with 9: because the electrons
are accelerated by the field. Hence p is not constant either.
Instead, the negative charge density is high near the cathode, low
near the anode, just as the density of cars on an expressway is high
near a trafiic slowdown, low where traffic is moving at high speed.

The current in a diode may be limited by an interesting effect: the
influence of the negative charge density (the ``space charge'') on the
electric field, hence on the acceleration and velocity of the electrons,
hence---completing the circle---on the charge density itself. Prob-
lem 4.25 explores the behavior of the ``space-charge-lirnited'' diode
and indicates how you can derive the curious voltage-current relation
which governs it. The relation is important in electronics not only
in the design and use of diodes but also in the design of electron guns
for cathode-ray tubes and the like.

4.3 Electrical Conductivity and Ohm's Law

There are many ways of causing charge to move, including what
we might call ``bodily transport'' of the charge carriers. In the
Van de Graaff electrostatic generator (see Prob. 4.3) an insulating
belt is given a surface charge, which it conveys to another electrode
for removal, much as an escalator conveys people. That constitutes
a perfectly good current. In the atmosphere, charged water droplets
falling because of their weight form a component of the electrical
current system of the earth. In this section we shall be interested in
a more common agent of charge transport, the force exerted on a
charge carrier by an electric field. An electric field tends to make
charge carriers move and thus tends to cause an electric current.
Whether or not it does so depends on the physical nature of the system
within which the field acts, the medium.

One of the earliest experimental discoveries about electric currents
in matter is summarized in Ohm's law:

_X
1- R (10)

% p. 115
The current I flowing through a wire is proportional to V, the difference
in potential between its ends. We have used q; heretofore as
the symbol for electric potential, and ((1)1 - (pg) or 9012 for the difference
of potential. In this section we shall use the symbol V, which
is more common in the elementary physics of electric circuits, and
comes, of course, from ``volts'' or ``voltage.'' (We had avoided V
merely because it suggests so many different things: Volume, velocity,
voltage.)

For a given piece of wire maintained at the same temperature, the
resistance R, the constant of proportionality in Eq. 10, does not depend
on the amount of current flowing. The resistance does depend
in an obvious way on the length and cross section of the wire, being
proportional to the length L and inversely proportional to the area
of cross section A. Of course it also depends on the material of

which the conductor is made and all of this is expressed in the simple
formula:

R:p% (11)

The factor p is called the volume resistivity of the substance. Usually
resistance is measured in ohms, which goes with amperes for current
and with volts for potential difference in Ohm's law. The corresponding
unit of resistivity is the ohm-cm, if lengths are measured
in centimeters, and this is the unit which is commonly given in tables.

The electrical engineer is interested in Eqs. 10 and 11 chieffy for
calculating the resistance of parts of electrical circuits, and the
voltage-current relations in those circuits. The physicist---except
when he is designing electrical apparatus---sees these equations as
reflecting a most remarkable and general property of matter, which
it is his task to understand. The fundamental fact which the equa-
tions, taken together, reflect, is this: In solid homogeneous materials
the current density at any point is proportional to the electric field
and the constant of proportionality depends only on the substance-
not, for instance, on the shape of the conductor. That is,

J = 0E (12)

where a is a constant characteristic of the substance.

In the interior of most conductors, three perpendicular directions
are physically equivalent. For instance, in copper the atoms are
arranged on a cubic (face-centered cubic) lattice. But even when

its atomic arrangement is not cubical, a piece of metal is usually

% p. 116
ractical units

composed of many small crystals randomly oriented, which makes
all directions equivalent in any large-scale average. In all such sub-
stances, there being no preferred direction, J will have the same
direction as E, and the constant 0 is simply a sca1ar.T We call it the
electrical conductivity of the material. The conductivity a is just the
reciprocal of the resistivity p.32 Figure 4.3 summarizes these simple
relations, and shows how Eqs. 10 and 11 are implied by Eq. 12.

Tln general, a linear relation between two vectors involves a tensor. We'1l meet an
important example of a tensor in Chap. 9. There are a few substances in which the
conductivity is quite different in different directions and has to be treated as a tensor,
but we needn't worry about them.

IThe Greek letters p and a are the symbols usually adopted for resistivity and con-
ductivity, in spite of their equally common usage for volume charge density and surface
charge density. There just aren't enough letters to go round.

v....r,. - '_.vvuu- uv \/vvlI\/Ivvu AL-

A word about units and dimensions. The common unit for conductivity
is derived from the practical unit of resistance, the ohm. As
you well know, the ohm is one volt per ampere. Conductivity is the
current density amperes/cm?

field strength volts/cm

or (ohm-cm)'1, often read as ``reciprocal ohm-centimeter.'' More
often, the reciprocal of the conductivity, called the resistivity, is given.
The practical unit is the ohm-centimeter, and the usual symbol is p.
The resistivity of a good conductor at room temperature is typically
a few millionths of an ohm-centimeter. Thus pure copper has a
resistivity at room temperature of 1.7 x l0'3 ohm-cm, or a conductivity
of 5.8 )< 105 (ohm-cm)'1.

In the CGS electrostatic system there is no special name for the
unit of conductivity or resistivity, but since that system of units is
built on the centimeter, gram, and second, and nothing else, the unit
must be some combination of these. What, for instance, are the
dimensions of resistivity?

ratio which in practical units would be

Resistivity =  : "fie ilgfig (13)
current density cm? cm?

which reduces simply to seconds. Resistivity has the dimensions of
time, and the appropriate name for the unit would be the second!
In these units the resistivity of copper is 1O'17 sec, that of glass at
room temperature of the order of 103 sec. We shall find later that
this curious association of a time with a material has a reasonable
physical interpretation.

4.4 A Model for Electrical Conduction

Equation 12 is merely a description of the observed behavior of
most familiar substances over a certain range of conditions. We
cannot derive it from the fundamental laws of the electric field. To
understand its significance we have to understand the processes that
go on in a particular substance when an electric field is applied, and
these may be very different in different kinds of matter. What is
truly remarkable about Ohm's law is the variety of substances and
the wide range of field strengths over which it is quite accurately

obeyed. (It does fail, indeed it must fail, in some circumstances, and
we shall discover some reasons whv_\ We shall trv now to describe

% p. 118
in detail the process of electrical conduction in one model system.
It will be reasonably typical of a wide class of electrical conductors,
but not of all.

We need charge carriers, so let us imagine a medium consisting of
positive and negative charge carriers in equal number, say N of each
kind per cubic centimeter. The positive carriers are ions of mass M+
each, carrying charge e, while the negative carriers are negative ions
of mass M_ each, with charge -e. The current density J will be
determined by the average velocities of these carriers.

A uniform electric field E, constant in time, is applied to this sys-
tem, exerting a force on every charge carrier. This is the first oc-
casion, in this volume, on which we have considered the force on a
moving charge in an electric field. We shall treat the question carefully
in Chap. 6. The fact is---and it was already used in Vol. I---that
the force is the same as if the charge carrier were at rest. That is,
each carrier of charge q, regardless of its motion, experiences the
constant force qE.

At this point let us pause to marvel that Ohm's law is ever obeyed!
A constant force on a free charge carrier ought to produce a constant
acceleration. But constant current density is associated with constant
velocity, not constant acceleration. If our system really does
obey Ohm's law, it must be because average velocity is proportional
to force, for our carriers. This warns us that the charge carriers cannot
be moving freely; there must be something which opposes the
motion that the electric field causes.

We do not have to look far to find a source of frictional hindrance
---it arises from the collisions the charge carriers experience as they
move among one another and among any other particles that may
inhabit the medium.

Just how this works out will depend somewhat on the details of
our model. Let us be rather specific and think of a gas consisting of
neutral atoms, positive ions, and negative ions at something like normal
gas density, roughly l019 atoms/cm?' (Fig. 4.4). Suppose there
is a preponderance of neutral atoms, with positive and negative ions
here and there among them. The distance between particles,
whether neutral or charged, is much larger than the atomic or ionic
radii so that an ion spends most of its time not involved in a close
collision.

In the absence of an electric field the atoms and ions will be moving
about in random directions, with speeds that are determined by
the temperature. The kinetic theory of gases can give us the rela-

% p. 119
tion, if we should need it, between the temperature and the average
kinetic energy of a particle. If we could look in at a particular ion
at a particular instant, say t = 0, we would find it moving with some
velocity u. What will happen next? The ion will move in a straight
line at constant speed until, presently, it chances to come close to an
atom, close enough for short-range forces to come into play. In this
collision, the total kinetic energy and the total momentum of the two
bodies will be conserved, but the speed and direction of the ion's
flight will be altered---perhaps only a little, perhaps drastically---to
a new velocity u'. Later a new collision occurs, changing the velocity
to u", and so it goes. It can also happen that another ion some distance
away, interacting with our ion by the long-range Coulomb
force, deflects the ion's path. Long-range encounters, which can be
important between ions and ions, mostly change the velocity in
smaller random increments, but the eventual efi°ect is the same.
The eventual effect---and this is the key to our problem---is to wipe
out any relation (either in magnitude or direction) between the
velocity u of the ion at t = 0 and its velocity after some interval has
elapsed. That is to say, after some time t = r the ion's velocity vector
is as likely to be found pointing in one direction in space as in
another, regardless of the direction it had at t = 0. The ion has
``forgotten'' the direction in which it was originally moving. To put
it another way, if we picked 10,000 cases of ions moving horizontally
south, and followed each of them for 1' seconds, their final velocity
directions would be distributed impartially over a sphere. It may
take several collisions to wipe out most of the direction memory or
only a few, depending on whether collisions involving large momentum
changes or small momentum changes are the more common,
and this depends on the nature of the interaction. An extreme case
is the collision of hard elastic spheres, which turns out to produce a
complete directional ``shufile'' in just one collision. We need not
worry about these differences. The point is that, whatever the nature
of the collisions, there will be some time interval 7, characteristic of
a given system, such that the lapse of 1- seconds leads to substantial
loss of correlation between the initial velocity direction and the final
velocity direction of an ion in that system.1' This characteristic time

'r It would be possible to define ~r precisely for a general system by giving a quantitative
measure of the correlation between initial and final directions. It is a statistical prob-
lem, like devising a measure of the correlation between the birth weights of rats and

their weights at maturity. However, we shall not need a general quantitative definition
to complete our analysis.

% p. 120
~r will depend on the ion and on the nature of its average environ-
ment; it will certainly be shorter the more frequent the collisions,
since in our gas nothing happens to an ion between collisions.

Now we are ready to apply a uniform electric field E to the system.
It will make the description easier if we imagine the loss of direction
memory to occur completely at a single collision, as we have said it
does in the case of hard spheres. Our main conclusion will actually
be independent of this assumption. Immediately after acollision
an ion starts off in some random direction. We will denote by uc
the velocity immediately after a collision. The electric force on the
ion, Ee, imparts momentum to the ion continuously. After time t
it will have acquired from the field a momentum increment Eet,
which simply adds vectorially to its original momentum Muc. Its
momentum is now Mu" + Eet. If the momentum increment is small
relative to Muc, that implies the velocity has not been affected much,
so we can expect the next collision to occur about as soon as it would
have in the absence of the electric field. In other words the average
time between collisions, which we shall denote by t, is independent
of the field E if the field is not too strong.

The momentum acquired from the field is always a vector in the
same direction. But it is lost, in effect, at every collision, since the
direction of motion after a collision is random, regardless of the
direction before.

What is the average momentum of all the positive ions, at a given
instant of time? This question is surprisingly easy to answer if we
look at it this way: At the instant in question, suppose we stop the
clock and ask each ion how long it has been since its last collision.
Suppose we get the particular answer t1 from positive ion 1. Then
that ion must have momentum eEt1 in addition to the momentum
Mulc with which it emerged from its last collision. The average
momentum of all N positive ions is therefore

Mm = 717. 2 (Mu,-0 + eEt,-) (14)
1

Here u,-0 is the velocity the jth ion had just after its last collision.
These velocities u,-0 are quite random in direction and therefore contribute
zero to the average. The second part is simply Ee times the
average of the t,~, that is, times the average of the time since the last
collision. That must be the same as the average of the time to the

% p. 121
next collision, and both are the samef as the average time between
collisions, i. We conclude that the average velocity of a positive ion,
in the presence of the steady field E, is

1-1, =  (15)

This shows that the average velocity of a charge carrier is proportional
to the force applied to it. If we observe only the average
velocity, it looks as if the medium were resisting the motion with a
force proportional to the velocity. That is the kind of frictional drag
you feel if you try to stir thick syrup with a spoon, a ``viscous'' drag.
Whenever charge carriers behave like this, we can expect something
like Ohm's law.

In Eq. 15 we have written f+ because the mean time between collisions
may well be different for positive and negative ions. The negative
ions acquire velocity in the opposite direction, but since they
carry negative charge their contribution to the current density J adds

to that of the positives. The equivalent of Eq. 3.24, with the two sorts
of ions included, is now

_ eEa)_ (-eEa)_ 2(L ?_-)
J_Ne(M+ Ne M_ _Ne M++M_ E (16)

Our theory predicts that the system will obey Ohm's law, for
Eq. 16 expresses a linear relation between J and E, the other quantities
being constants characteristic of the medium. Compare Eq. 16

with Eq. 12. The constant Ne?  +  appears in the role of
+ _

0, the conductivity.

We made a number of rather special assumptions about this sys-
tem, but looking back, we can see that they were not essential so far
as the linear relation between E and J is concerned. Any system
containing a constant density of free charge carriers, in which the
motion of the carriers is frequently ``re-randomized'' by collisions or

TYou may think the average time between collisions would have to be equal to the
sum of the average time since the last collision and the average time to the next. That
would be true if collisions occurred at absolutely regular intervals, but they don't. They
are independent random events, and for such the above statement, paradoxical as it may
seem at first. is true. Think about it. The question does not aff"ect our main conclusion,
but if you unravel it you will have grown in statistical wisdom. (Hint: If one collision
doesn't aff'ect the probability of having another---that's what independent means---it

can't matter whether you start the clock at some arbitrary time, or at the time of a
collision.)

% p. 122
other interactions within the system, ought to obey Ohm's law if the
field E is not too strong. The ratio of J to E, which is the conductivity
o of the medium, will be proportional to the number of charge
carriers and to the characteristic time 7, the time for loss of directional
correlation. It is only through this last quantity that all the
complicated details of the collisions enter the problem. The making
of a detailed theory of the conductivity of any given system, assuming
the number of charge carriers is known, amounts to making a theory
for 1'. In our particular example this quantity was replaced by T and
a perfectly definite result was predicted for the conductivity 0. In-
troducing the more general quantity r, and also allowing for the
possibility of different numbers of positive and negative carriers, we
can summarize our theory as follows:

0: e2|:N+T+ N_T_]

M+ + M_ (17)
We use the sign 2 to acknowledge that we did not give 7 a precise
definition. That could be done, however.

To emphasize the fact that electrical conduction ordinarily involves
only a slight systematic drift superimposed on the random motion
of the charge carriers, we have constructed Fig. 4.5 as an artificial
microscopic View of the kind of system we have been talking about.
Positive ions are represented by white dots, negative ions by circles.
We assume the latter are electrons and hence, because of their small
mass, so much more mobile than the positive ions that we may neglect
the motion of the positives altogether. In Fig. 4.5a we see a wholly
random distribution of particles and of electron speeds. To make
the diagram, the location and sign of a particle were determined by a
random-number table. The electron velocity vectors were likewise
drawn from a random distribution, one corresponding to the ``Max-
wellian'' distribution of molecular velocities in a gas. In Fig. 4.519
We have used the same positions, but now the velocities have all a
small added increment to the right. That is, Fig. 4.519 is a view of
an ionized material in which there is a net flow of negative charge to
the right, equivalent to a positive current to the left. Fig. 4.5a illustrates
the situation with zero average current.

Obviously we should not expect the actual average of the velocities
of the 46 electrons in Fig. 4.5a to be exactly zero, for they are statistically
independent quantities. One electron doesn't affect the behavior
of another. There will in fact be a randomly fluctuating
electric current in the absence of any driving field, simply as a result

% p. 123
of statistical fluctuations in the vector sum of the electron velocities.
This spontaneously fluctuating current can be measured. It is a
source of ``noise'' in all electrical circuits, and often determines the
ultimate limit of sensitivity of devices for detecting weak electrical
signals. In Vol. V of this course you will read more about this.

4.5 Where Ohm's Law Fails

We can see now how 0hm's law can break down. Suppose the
electric field E is so strong that an ion acquires, between collisions,
an added velocity comparable to its average thermal speed. That
will seriously affect the average time between collisions, f+ or L,
appearing in Eq. 16. These times are now functions of E, not con-
stants, and Eq. 16 is no longer linear. That is, doubling the field
strength E will not double the current density J if fhas to change too.
Let's see where this might set in, in a typical case. Our model
resembles a weakly ionized gas. The mean free path of an ion in a

% p. 124
gas at normal density is of the order of 10'5 cm. The average kinetic
energy of random motion is of the order of kT, where k is Boltzmann's
constant that occurs in the kinetic theory of gases. Our velocity
criterion can also be stated this way: We expect trouble if the additional
kinetic energy the ion acquires from the field between collisions
is comparable to kT. Setting these two. energies approximately
equal:

eE~lO'6 cmzkT (18)

and putting in the numbers, we find E z 80 statvolts/cm. That is
a moderately strong field as fields go in the laboratory; it amounts
to 24 kilovolts/cm. Of course this limit depends directly on the free
path. Ionized gases at low pressure, where the mean free path is very
long, may show departures from Ohm's law under quite weak fields.

Very intense electric fields can lead to more drastic changes, such
as changes in the number of carriers. That is what happens in an
electric spark. The charge carriers already present gain so much
energy from the field that their collisions with other atoms are violent
enough to ionize the latter, making more charge carriers and so on.
The resulting avalanche is a catastrophic breakdown of Ohm's law!

We can anticipate a breakdown of our theory, if not of Ohm's law,
in another quarter. Suppose the field E to be applied for only a very
short time. If this time is comparable to, or shorter than, the critical
time 1-, we clearly have to revise our picture. To make this quite
evident, consider applying an alternating electric field, alternating
with a period short compared to the time between collisions. Then
the response of the carriers will be determined largely by their inertia
as free bodies. Whatever the nature of the problem, and it is an interesting
one which you may meet in the future, the theory we have
outlined is inadequate for it. Notice, however, that the mean time
between collisions in the gas we have just used as an example will be
something like (l0'5 cm/molecular speed) for the positive ions,
which is of the order of l0'1° sec, and even shorter for electrons. So
our theory, although developed for a constant field, ought to work
for many systems, even with very rapidly varying fields.

The vacuum diode described in Sec. 4.2 is a conspicuously ``non-
ohmic'' device. Under one set of conditions, when the supply of
electrons is limited by their rate of emission from the cathode, the
current is practically independent of the voltage, if the anode is posi-
tive. If the anode is negative, the current is zero, for the anode cannot
emit electrons at all. The diode passes current in one direction

% p. 125
only. It is commonly used as a rectifier of alternating current.
Under the condition of space-charge-limited current, explored in
Prob. 4.25, the current in the diode is proportional to the 3/2 power
of the voltage, instead of the first power as called for by Ohm's law.

The junction between two semiconductor materials, or between a
semiconductor and a metal, can be highly nonohrnic and, like the
vacuum diode, unidirectional. Nonlinear devices are indispensable
in electronics (as in life). If everything commenced to obey Ohm's
law, electronic technology would be wiped out.

4.6 Electrical Conductivity of Metals

The metals are the best conductors we know of. The simple picture
of electrical conduction that we have just described was developed
late in the nineteenth century by Drude and others, to explain
the conductivity of metals. The theory was greatly refined in its details
by Lorentz, and was in some respects rather fruitful. There
was no doubt that the high conductivity of metals was due to
free electrons, free in the sense of not being attached to any single
atom, able to move through the whole crystal lattice. A convincing
proof was the utter absence of any transport of chemically identifiable
material in a metal circuit through which current had been flowing.
The chemistry of the metallic elements and the early quantum theory
of atomic structure combined to suggest that metal atoms easily lose
one or two outer electrons. These would be bound to the atom if it
were isolated, but come loose when many similar atoms are packed
close together in a crystal. The lattice itself is then composed of the
residual positive ions, locked into a regular and rigid array. Through
this lattice of ions the ``conduction electrons'' wander. Even if only
one electron per metal atom has come loose, the resulting density of
charge carriers would be enormously greater than it is in substances
where the ions have to be created by other means. The number of
atoms per cubic centimeter in sodium metal is 2.5 X 1022.

As we have seen, the mobility of a charge carrier is essentially determined
by the time 7 over which it can accumulate directed
momentum from the applied electric field. This is true whatever
process may be going on. If we believe that the number of charge
carriers in sodium is one per atom, and that these are electrons of

mass me, we need only the experimentally measured conductivity of
sodium to calculate T. The conductivitv o of sodium at room tem-

% p. 126
perature in electrostatic units is 1.9 X 1017 esu/sec-cm-statvolt.
From Eq. 17, omitting the positive carriers altogether,

: 3 X 10*" see p (19)

'T_Z

This seems a surprisingly long time for an electron to move through
the crystal lattice without suffering serious deflection. The thermal
speed of an electron at room temperature, according to kinetic
theory, ought to be about 107 cm/sec, so that in 3 X l0'14 see an
electron would travel 30 angstr0ms-more than ten lattice spaces.

Why is the lattice of ions so transparent to the electrons? Remem-
ber that, insofar as one can speak of size, the ions nearly touch one
another in a compact lattice. Also, the rise and fall of electrical
potential along a path through the lattice ought to be very large compared
to the energy in electron volts of an electron at room tempera-
ture. On the other hand, if it isn't a collision with an ion that interrupts
the electron's flight, what does? These crucial questions could
not really be answered until the wave nature of the electron was dis-
covered. Indeed, the behavior of electrons in metals confronted
physics, before quantum mechanics, with a set of stubborn para-
doxes. We shall return to these questions later when you are
equipped with some background in quantum physics. For our
present task, we can do as generations of physicists had to do---take
the remarkable electrical conductivity of metals for granted.

We can, however, keep some of the essentials of our picture of
conduction, even here. The conduction current is carried by elec-
trons; it represents a slow systematic drift of the carriers, superimposed
on their much more rapid random motion. Also, it is an
eventual scattering or deflection of the electron by the lattice that
makes the drift velocity proportional to the field, and hence makes
the current obey Ohm's law.

In most metals Ohm's law is obeyed exceedingly accurately up to
current densities far higher than any that can be long maintained.
No deviation has ever been clearly demonstrated experimentally.
According to one theoretical prediction, departures of the order of
1 percent might be expected at a current density of 109 amp/cmz.
That is roughly a million times the current density one finds in
ordinary wires in circuits.

The conductivity of pure metals increases with lowering tempera-
ture. That would be a bit difficult to explain with our previous

% p. 127
theory. And any notion that a ``billiard-ball'' kind of picture can be
devised to account for all aspects of metallic conduction is made to
seem ridiculous by the startling phenomenon of superconductivity.
Many metals at low temperature begin to conduct in a manner that,
if one tries to describe it by a conductivity, requires the conductivity
to be infinite! (And not even that assumption really fits their fantastic
electrical behavior.)

The chart in Fig. 4.6 shows the conductivities of a variety of pure
substances, and their variation with temperature. Its main purpose
is to exhibit the wide range of values and behavior. Note that

abscissa (temperature) and ordinate (conductivity) are both logarithmic
scales.

4.7 Resistance of Conductors

It is a simple matter to calculate the resistance R of a uniform wire

when the resistivity of the material is given. We have already written
down the formula in Eq. 11:

length )< resistivity

R = .
area Of CTOSS SCCIIOII

(20)

The resistance R has meaning only for a well-defined current flow.
In the case of a wire there is no doubt of the meaning. If we have the
more general case of a volume distribution of current we can't talk
about the resistance without locating the ``binding posts'' where the
current enters and leaves the system. The distribution of current
density throughout the volume has to be determined by our basic
relation J = aE.

To illustrate this, we examine the flow of current in the object
shown in Fig. 4.7a and b, which consists of two cylindrical copper
sleeves with the space between them filled with graphite. What is
the resistance between the terminals? If the resistance of the copper
tubes to longitudinal current flow is very small compared to the
resistance of the graphite to radial current flow, it should not make
much difference where the current enters and leaves the copper (that
is, where the terminals are located). In that case, we may assume
each copper tube is an equipotential. Looking at the chart in Fig. 4.6,
we see that we have more than a factor of 103 between copper and
graphite, around room temperature, so the assumption seems safe if
the copper is not extremely thin. Proceeding on that assumption, let
V0 be the potential difference between the copper electrodes. To

and determine the constant k by requiring that

Hence the field magnitude at any radius r in the graphite is

What if the copper sleeves had been extremely thin layers of metal,
with a resistance to longitudinal flow not small compared to the
transverse resistance of the graphite? We shall not try to solve that
problem, but it is instructive to think how the lines of current flow

might look. Figure 4.70 and d suggests the distribution, for two
different locations of the terminals.

4.8 Circuits and Circuit Elements

Electrical devices usually have well-defined terminals to which
wires can be connected. Charge can flow into or out of the device
over these paths. In particular, if two terminals, and only two, are
connected by wires to something outside, and if the current flow is
steady with constant potentials everywhere, then obviously the current
must be equal and opposite at the two terminals.1' In that case

Tlt is perfectly possible to have 4 amp flowing into one terminal of a two-terminal
object with 3 amp flowing out at the other terminal. But then the object is accumulating
positive charge at the rate of 1 coulomb/sec. Its potential must be changing very rap-

idly---and that can't go on for long. Hence this cannot be a steady, or time-independent,
current.

% p. 130
we can speak of the current I which flows through the device, and of
the voltage V ``between the terminals'' or ``across the terminals,''
which means their difference in electrical potential. The ratio V/I for
some given I is a certain number of resistance units (ohms, if V is in
volts and I in amperes). If Ohm's law is obeyed in all parts of the
obj ect through which current flows, that number will be a constant,
independent of the current. This one number completely describes
the electrical behavior of the object, for steady current flow (``dc'')
between the given terminals. With these rather obvious remarks we
introduce a simple idea, the notion of a circuit element.

Look at the five boxes in Fig. 4.8. Each has two terminals, and
inside each box there is some stuff, different in every box. If any one
of these boxes is made part of an electrical circuit by connecting wires
to the terminals, the ratio of the potential difference between the
terminals to the current flowing in the wire that we have connected
to the terminal will be found to be 65 ohms. We say the resistance
between the terminals, in each box, is 65 ohms. This statement
would surely not be true for all conceivable values of the current or
potential difference. As the potential difference or voltage between
the terminals is raised, various things might happen, earlier in some
boxes than in others, to change the voltage / current ratio. You might
be able to guess which boxes would give trouble first. Still, there is
some limit below which they all behave linearly, and within that
range, for steady currents, the boxes are alike. They are alike in this
sense: if any circuit contains one of these boxes, which box it is makes
no difference in the behavior of that circuit. The box is equivalent
to a 65-ohm resistorrf We represent it by the symbol MAN and
in the description of the circuit of which the box is one component,
we replace the box with this abstraction. An electrical circuit or
network is then a collection of such circuit elements joined to one
another by paths of negligible resistance.

Taking a network consisting of many elements connected together

and selecting two points as terminals, we can regard the whole thing
as equivalent, as far as these two terminals are concerned, to a single
resistor. We say that the physical network of objects in Fig. 4.9a is
represented by the diagram of Fig. 4.919 and for the terminals A1A2

'i'We use the term resistor for the actual object designed especially for that function.
Thus a ``200-ohm, lO-watt, wire-wound resistor'' is a device consisting of a coil of wire
on some insulating base, with terminals, intended to be used in such a way that the average
power dissipated in it is not more than 10 watts.

% p. 131
the equivalent circuit is Fig. 4.9c. The equivalent circuit for the terminals
at BIB2 is given in Fig. 4.9d. If you put this assembly in a
box with only that pair of terminals accessible, it will be indistinguishable
from a resistor of 57.6 ohms resistance. There is one very
important ru1e---only direct-current measurements are allowed! All
that we have said depends on the current and electric fields being
constant in time; if they are not, the behavior of a circuit element
may not depend on its resistance alone. The concept of equivalent
circuit can be extended from these dc networks to systems in which
current and voltage vary with time. Indeed, that is where it is most
valuable. We are not quite ready to explore that domain.

Little time will be spent here on methods for calculating the
equivalent resistance of a network of circuit elements. The cases of
series and parallel groups are easy. A combination like that in

Fig. 4.10 is two resistors, of value R1 and R2, in series. The equivalent
resistance is

% p. 132
  

 

A combination like Fig. 4.11 is two resistors in parallel. By an argument
that you should be able to give, the equivalent resistance R is
found as follows:

1 1 1 B1B;
---:j --- R24
R R1 +32 °r , R1+R2

(26)

That is all that is needed to handle a circuit like the one shown in
Fig. 4.12, which for all its ornateness can be reduced, step by step,
to series or parallel combinations. However, the simple network of
Fig. 4.13 cannot be so reduced, so a more general method is required.
Any conceivable network of resistors in which a constant current is
flowing has to satisfy these conditions:

(i) The current through each element must equal the voltage
across that element divided by the resistance of the
-element.

(ii) At a node of the network, a point where three or more connecting
wires meet, the algebraic sum of the currents into
the node must be zero. (This is our old charge-conserva-
tion condition, Eq. 7, in circuit language.)

(iii) The sum of the potential differences taken in order around
a loop of the network, a path beginning and ending at the
same node, is zero. (This is network language for the
general property of the static electric field: f E - ds = 0 for
any closed path.)

The algebraic statement of these conditions for any network will
provide exactly the number of independent linear equations needed
to ensure that there is one and only one solution for the equivalent
resistance between two selected nodes. We assert this without proving
it. It is interesting to note that the structure of a dc network
problem depends only on the topology of the network, that is, on
those features of the diagram of connections that are independent
of any distortion of the lines of the diagram.

A dc network of resistances is a linear system---the voltages and
currents are governed by a set of linear equations, the statements of
the conditions (i), (ii), and (iii). Therefore the superposition of
different possible states of the network is also a possible state. F ig-
ure 4.14 shows a section of a network with certain currents, I1,
12, \ldots , flowing in the wires and certain potentials, V1, V2, \ldots , at
the nodes. If some other set of currents and potentials, say 11, \ldots ,

% p. 133
V3, \ldots , is another possible state of aff'airs in this section of network,
then so is the set (11 + Ii), ..., (V1 + Vi), .... These currents
and voltages corresponding to the superposition will also satisfy the
conditions (i), (ii), and (iii). Certain general theorems about net-

works, interesting and useful to the electrical engineer, are based
on this.

4.9 Energy Dissipation in Current Flow

The flow of current in a resistor involves the dissipation of energy.
If it takes a force F to push a charge carrier along with average
velocity v, any agency that accomplishes this must do work at the
rate F - v. If an electric field E is driving the ion of charge q, then
F = qE, and the rate at which work is done is qE - v. The energy
thus expended shows up eventually as heat. In our model of ionic
conduction the way this comes about is quite clear. The ion acquires
some extra kinetic energy, as well as momentum, between collisions.
A collision, or at most a few collisions, redirects its momentum at
random but does not necessarily restore the kinetic energy to normal.

% p. 134
F or that to happen the ion has to transfer kinetic energy to the obstacle
that deflects it. Suppose the charge carrier has a considerably
smaller mass than the neutral atom it collides with. The average
transfer of kinetic energy is small when a billiard ball collides with
a bowling ball. Therefore the ion (billiard ball) will continue to
accumulate extra energy until its average kinetic energy is so high
that its average loss of energy in a collision equals the amount gained
between collisions. In this way, by first ``heating up'' the charge
carriers themselves, the work done by the electric force driving the
charge carriers is eventually passed on to the rest of the medium as
random kinetic energy, or heat.

Suppose a steady current I, in amperes, flows through a resistor
of R ohms. In every second, I coulombs of charge are transferred
through a potential difference of V volts, where V = IR. Hence the
work done in 1 sec is IZR, in joules. (1 coulomb X 1 volt : 1 joule =
107 ergs.) The watt, or volt-ampere, is the corresponding unit of
power P (rate of doing work). (1 watt = 1 joule/sec.)

P = 123 (27)

Naturally the steady flow of current in a dc circuit requires some
source of energy capable of maintaining the electric field that drives
the charge carriers. Until now we have avoided the question of the
electromotive force by studying only parts of entire circuits; we kept
the ``battery'' out of the picture. In Sec. 4.10 we shall discuss some
sources of electromotive force.

4.10 Electromotive Force and the Voltaic Cell

The origin of the electromotive force in a direct-current circuit is
some mechanism that transports charge carriers in a direction opposite
to that in which the electric field is trying to move them.
A Van de Graalf electrostatic generator (Fig. 4.15) is an example on
a large scale. With everything running steadily, we find current in
the external resistance flowing in the direction of the electric field E,
and energy being dissipated there (appearing as heat) at the rate
I V0, or PR. Inside the column of the machine, too, there is a down-
ward-directed electric field. Here charge carriers can be moved
against the field if they are stuck to a nonconducting belt. They are
stuck so tightly that they can't slide backward along the belt in the
generally downward electric field. (They can still be removed from
the belt by a much stronger field localized at the brush in the termi-

% p. 135
nal. We need not consider here the means for putting charge on and
off the belt near the pulleys.) The energy needed to pull the belt is
supplied from elsewhere---usually by an electric motor connected to
a power line, but it could be a gasoline engine, or even a man turning
a crank. This Van de Graaff generator is in effect a battery with an
electromotive force, under these conditions, of V0 volts.

In ordinary batteries it is chemical energy that makes the charge
carriers move through a region where the electric field opposes their
motion. That is, a positive charge carrier may move to a place of
higher electric potential if by so doing it can engage in a chemical
reaction that will yield more energy than it costs to climb the electrical
hill.

To see how this works, let us examine one particular voltaic cell.
Voltaic cell is the generic name for a chemical source of electromotive
force. In the experiments of Galvani around 1790 the famous
twitching frogs' legs had signaled the chemical production of electric
current. It was Volta who proved that the source was not ``animal
electricity,'' as Galvani maintained, but the contact of dissimilar
metals in the circuit. Volta went on to construct the first battery, a
stack of elementary cells, each of which consisted of a zinc disk and
a copper disk separated by moistened pasteboard. Volta's ``pile,'' as
it was called, was the first practical source of steady electric current.
There are many kinds of voltaic cells, including the ubiquitous ``dry
cell.'' The automobile battery consists, if it is a ``l2-Volt'' battery, of
six lead-sulfuric acid cells in series. We shall describe another
variety of cell, the Weston standard cell, the chemistry of which
happens to be rather simple. In addition, the Weston cell is uniquely

important in the laboratory as the standard for precise voltage
measurements.

One form of Weston cell is illustrated in Fig. 4.16. The device
consists of an H-shaped glass container filled with an aqueous solution
of cadmium sulfate, CdSO4. An external lead is sealed into the
bottom of each leg, making contact to the inner electrodes. These
consist, on the left, of a pool of pure mercury and, on the right, of a
pool of mercury in which cadmium metal has been dissolved.
(Many metals will dissolve in mercury; such a solution is called an
amalgam.) Above the mercury pool on the left are some crystals of
mercurous sulfate, Hg2SO4, a compound that is only very slightly
soluble in water. We find a difference of potential between the external
leads, the one on the left being positive with respect to the one

on the right. (The absolute value of the potential is irrelevant; only
differences are significant here \ What hae hanmamnd is that enmp

% p. 136
cadmium ions have gone into the water solution from the amalgam,
each leaving two electrons behind, until the amalgam electrode is
left with a substantial negative charge. This exodus stopped, how-
ever, when the electrode contained so many extra electrons that their
attraction discouraged any more cadmiums from abandoning their
electrons and leaving.

If we now provide an external conduction path by connecting a
resistor across the cell, electrons will flow over this external path
from the negative electrode to the positive electrode. This will allow
more Cd'' ions to go into solution, the electrons they leave behind
merely replenishing the negative charge on that electrode. A steady
current will continue, accompanied by a migration of ions, completing
the circuit, through the aqueous solution. Meanwhile, things
are happening at the other electrode. Figure 4.17 shows what is
going on, while current is flowing around the circuit, at each of the
two interfaces between electrode and solution (electrolyte). In
Fig. 4.17a mercury ions, Hg+, are leaving the solution, meeting electrons
coming from the outside, and thus becoming neutral mercury
atoms. They are replaced in the solution by dissolving Hg2SO4,
which contributes at the same time a new sulfate ion to the electro-
lyte. In Fig. 4.1719 cadmium atoms continue to break up, entering
the electrolyte as Cd" ions.

The overall eff'ect is essentially the removal of electrons from cadmium
atoms and the addition of electrons to mercury ions. The
chemist would say that cadmium is being oxidized and mercury is
being reduced. The cell runs because this exchange is energetically
preferred. The relative binding of electrons in the structure of the
cadmium atom and in the structure of the mercury atom is such that,

so to speak, mercury ions like to gain electrons more than cadmium
atoms hate to lose them.

Notice that at each interface ions move against the electric field.
It is these transition layers, no more than some angstroms thick, that
correspond to the belt in the Van de Graaff generator.

Consider now the electrical potential changes over the whole sys-
tem, both with and without current flowing. In Fig. 4.18 the varia-

% p. 137
tion of potential around the circuit, which is open at one point, is
plotted on a vertical scale. The open-circuit potential difference
between the terminals is the electromotive force of the cell, denoted

by 8. The electric field is the negative gradient of the potential. As
in any other electrostatic field, the line integral of E around the com-

plete path is zero. (By the way, the level at which the potential of
the electrolyte has been drawn is rather arbitrary---one cannot
directly measure it.)

Figure 4.19 shows the potential distribution when current is flow-
ing through an external resistor. Within the electrolyte there is an
electric field in the direction of current flow. The cadmium sulfate
solution acts like an ordinary ohmic resistance. The potential difference
at the terminals is now less than 8, owing to the internal potential
drop across the electrolyte, and possibly also to extra resistance
in the transition layers. The line integral of the electric field
around the whole circuit is still zero. If current flows until Q coulombs
of charge have passed any point in the circuit, then SQ, with
8 in volts, is the energy in joules that has been dissipated, externally
and internally, at the expense of the chemical energy of the cell
constituents.

The chain of reactions in the cell is reversible. That is, if another
source, of greater electromotive force, were connected into the circuit
in opposition, current would flow the other way and the processes
we have described would run backward. That's what happens when
a storage battery is charged. In the common ``dry cell,'' some
irreversible changes occur during discharge, precluding reversal of
the process.

The electromotive force of a cell depends on atomic properties.
The values lie in the range of a volt or so because the binding energies
of the outer electrons of atoms are in the range of several electron
volts, and it is essentially the differences in these binding energies

% p. 138
that are manifest in the electromotive force. The electromotive force
depends somewhat on the temperature, a reminder that the proper
treatment of electrochemical processes is a problem in thermo-
dynamics. It is a central topic in physical chemistry. Strictly speak-
ing, it is not the energy, but the so-called free energy that is involved,
a thermodynamic distinction we cannot go into here.

The Weston cell itself is not used as a source of electrical energy but
rather as a standard for potential difference. The situation depicted
in Fig. 4.19, in which so large a current is flowing that the terminal
voltage has dropped by about 10 percent, would be a gross misuse of
the cell. The electromotive force of the Weston cell is highly repro-
ducible. In a slightly different version, in which the aqueous solution
is saturated with excess cadmium sulfate near both electrodes, the
electromotive force at 20°C is 1.0183 volts. Using a Weston cell as
a standard and a suitable potentiometer, voltages can be reliably
measured to an accuracy of one part in 100,000.

So far as its role in an external circuit is concerned, a cell can be
well represented by an equivalent circuit consisting of an electromotive
force 8 in series with a certain internal resistance R,. Con-
nection to an external resistance R results in a current

as shown in Fig. 4.20.

4.11 Variable Currents in Capacitors and Resistors

Let a capacitor of capacitance C be charged to some potential V0
and then discharged by suddenly connecting it across a resistance R.
Figure 4.21 shows the capacitor indicated by the conventional
symbol-II-, the resistor R, and a switch which we shall imagine to
be closed at time t = 0. It is obvious that as current flows the
capacitor will gradually lose its charge, the voltage across the capacitor
will diminish, and this in turn will lessen the flow of current. To
see exactly what happens we need only write down the conditions
that govern the circuit. Let Q be the charge on the capacitor at any
instant, V the potential difference between the plates which is also
the voltage across the resistance B. Let I be the current, considered
positive if it flows away from the positive side of the capacitor. These
quantities, all functions of the time, must be related as follows:

_ _V d_Q_
Q_CV 1-3 _dt_1 (28)

% p. 139
Eliminating I and V, we obtain the equation which governs the time
variation of Q:

d_Q _ _ £

dt _ RC (29)
Writing this in the form

dQ _ dt

? - ' R (30)

we can integrate both sides, obtaining
_ ;t
lnQ_ RC+const (31)

The solution of our differential equation is therefore:
Q = (another constant) x e"/RC (32)

We said that at t : O, V = V0, so that Q = CV0 for t = O. This

determines the constant and we now have the exact behavior of Q
after the switch is closed:

Q : CV06_t/RC 

The behavior of the current I is found directly from this:

1 = _ 'ET? = %e-t/RC (34)

At the closing of the switch the current rises at once to the value
V0/R and then ``decays'' exponentially to zero. The time that characterizes
this decay is the constant RC. We should not be surprised to
find that the product of resistance and capacitance has the dimensions
of time, for we know that C has the dimensions of length, and
we have already remarked that resistance >< length, when it appears
as ohm-cm, the unit of resistivity, has the dimensions of time. People
often speak of the ``RC time constant'' associated with a circuit or
part of a circuit.

In the practical system of units the unit of capacitance is the farad.
A capacitor of one farad capacitance has a charge of one coulomb
for a potential difference of one volt. With R in ohms and C in
farads, the product RC is a time in seconds. Just to check this,
note that ohm = volt/ampere = volt-sec/coulomb, while farad =
coulomb/volt. If we make the circuit of Fig. 4.21 out of a 0.05-

% p. 140
microfarad capacitor and a 5-megohm resistor, both of which are
reasonable objects to find around any laboratory, we would have
RC = 5 X 105 X 0.05 X 10*' or 0.25 sec.

Quite generally, in any electrical system made up of charged conductors
and resistive current paths, one time scale---perhaps not the
only one---for processes in the system is set by some resistance-
capacitance product. This has a bearing on our earlier observation
about the dimensions of resistivity. Imagine a capacitor with plates
of area A and separation s. Its capacitance C is A/(4773). Now
imagine the space between the plates suddenly filled with a conductive
medium of resistivity p. To avoid any question of how this might
affect the capacitance, let us suppose that the medium is a very
slightly ionized gas; a substance of that density will hardly affect the
capacitance at all. This new conductive path will discharge the
capacitor as effectively as did the external resistor in Fig. 4.21. How
quickly will this happen? The resistance of the path, R, is ps/A.
Hence the time constant RC is just (ps/A)(A/4ws) = p/477. This
time is independent of the proportions and the absolute size of the
capacitor. What we have here is simply the time constant for the
process of redistribution of charge or relaxation of the electric field,
in a conducting medium. We really didn't need the capacitor plates
at all to describe the situation. If we place two sheets of charge opposite
one another in a conducting medium, they will presently dis-
appear, the electric field will vanish, and the medium will be restored
to a constant potential. The relaxation time is determined by the
resistivity p. For instance, if our weakly ionized gas had a resistivity
of 103 ohm-cm, the relaxation time ought to be about 10 psec.

We remember that really good conductors like the metals have
resistivities of the order of 10'5 ohm-cm, which we now see implies
a relaxation time of the order of 10-13 sec. A number like this should
arouse our suspicion. Can it really be interpreted as the time required
for dissipation of a charge concentration in a conductor? We
note first of all that it is much shorter than any collision time or correlation
time that we might infer from our model of electrical con-
ductivity. In Eq. 19 we found 1-_ = 3 )< l0'14 sec for sodium at
room temperature. This already warns us that for phenomena on
so short a time scale we have no right whatever to use the ``dc'' re-
sistivity p. This throws doubt on any quantitative estimate of a
relaxation time.

However there is an even deeper reason to suspect that the story
is not complete. That is the curious fact that our electrical relaxation

% p. 141
time T = p/47r appears to be independent of the size of the region
involved. That is all very well if the region is small enough, but for
any finite relaxation time T, if the region involved has one dimension
greater than T times the speed of light, the relaxation would involve
the propagation of a charge readjustment at a speed greater than c.
That would be incompatible with relativity. Thus we see already
that if the behavior of electric charges and fields is to be consistent
with the postulates of special relativity, something more has to come
into the picture. That will be the subject of our next chapters.

Problems

4.1 We have 5 x 1010 doubly charged positive ions per cubic centimeter,
all moving west with a speed of 107 cm/ sec. In the same region there are 1011
electrons per cubic centimeter moving northeast with a speed of 103 cm/sec.
(Don't ask how we managed it!) What is the direction of J? What is its
magnitude in esu per second per square centimeter? In amperes per square
centimeter? Ans. 48.8° west ofsouth; 5.14 X 109 esu/sec-cmz; 1.71 amp/cmz.

4.2 In a 6-Bev electron synchrotron, electrons travel around the machine
in an approximately circular path 240 meters long. It is normal to have about
1011 electrons circling on this path during a cycle of acceleration. The speed
of the electrons is practically that of light. What is the current? We give this
very simple problem to emphasize that nothing in our definition of current
as rate of charge transport requires the velocities of the carriers to be nonrela-
tivistic and there is no rule against a given charged particle getting counted
many times during a second as part of the current.

4.3 In a Van de Graaff electrostatic generator, a rubberized belt 30 cm wide
travels at a velocity of 20 m/sec. The belt is given a surface charge at the lower
roller, the surface charge density being high enough to cause a field of 40 stat-
volts/cm on each side of the belt. What is the current in milliamperes?

4.4 Consider a vacuum diode which has plane-parallel cathode and anode,
as in Fig. 4.2. The distance between the cathode and anode is s cm, the area
of each is A cm2, and the current of electrons emitted from the cathode and
passing to the anode amounts to I esu/ sec. Taking the cathode potential as
zero, the anode potential is maintained at V0 statvolts, positive. As a function
of x, the distance from the cathode, what is the electron velocity v, and
what is the space charge density p? Assume that the current is so slight that
the electric field is not affected by the space charge, and assume that electrons
leave the cathode with zero initial velocity.

4.5 If we estimate the number of conduction electrons in a metal like silver
to be the same as the number of atoms, what is the average drift velocity of
the conduction electrons in a silver wire 1 mm in diameter carrying a current
of 30 amperes? Give an approximate answer; guess any constants needed
in your calculation which are not among our tabulated constants.

4.6 A container filled with air at room temperature and pressure is exposed
to a beam of x rays which ionizes a small fraction of the molecules inside.
The negative ions are actually 02 molecules with an extra electron stuck on.
For the purposes of this problem, however, you may merely treat all the molecules
as having the same molecular weight somewhere between 02 and N2.
Let the box be 10 cm x 10 cm x 2 cm and assume that the 10 cm x 10 cm
faces are metal whereas the rest of the box is made of insulating material. An
emf of 1000 volts is applied across the conducting ends causing a current of
1.5 )< 10"6 amp to flow. What is the conductivity of this weakly ionized gas?
If the mean velocity of the ions is taken to be 5 x 104 cm/sec, and the mean
free path is 10-5 cm, what is the mean collision time? What fraction of the
molecules in the gas are ionized (assume equal numbers of positive and negative
singly charged ions)?

4.7 An experimenter wants to make a layer of aluminum 50 angstroms
thick by evaporating aluminum onto a clean glass surface in vacuum. He first
lays down by evaporation a fairly thick layer, with a central strip masked so
that it remains bare. Then, using another mask in the manner of a stencil, he
evaporates onto the glass a strip of the same width running across the gap,
meanwhile using the heavy patches as terminals for measurement of resistance.
At what value of the resistance should he stop the evaporation? (Resistivity
of pure aluminum at room temperature is 2.83 x 10'6 ohm-cm.)

4.8 Pure iron has a resistivity of 10.0 x 10"' ohm-cm at 20°C. The resis-
tivity of copper at that temperature is 1.77 x 10'" ohm-cm. Consider two
different composite conductors. Each is 1 meter long and has a square cross
section, 0.8 cm on a side. Conductor A is made by joining a 50-cm-long square
rod of iron and a similar bar of copper end-to-end. Conductor B consists of
1-meter-long rods of copper and iron, 0.4 by 0.8 cm in cross section, clamped
side by side. What is the resistance in ohms of each conductor between the
ends 1 meter apart? If a steady current flows in conductor A, in which material
will the power dissipation be greater? Answer the same question for rod B.

4.9 If you stretch a copper wire, making it 0.1 percent longer, how much
would you guess that this would change its resistance? What assumptions are
you making about the behavior of copper in deformation?

4.10 Two electrodes consisting of metal spheres 1 ft in diameter are sus- I
pended in the deep ocean by insulated cables. The spheres hang at a depth "
of 200 ft; the horizontal distance between them is 1000 ft. The circuit is completed
by an insulated cable supported near the surface, running back to a ship
over one of the spheres. Taking the conductivity of sea water as 0.04
(ohm-cm)'1, estimate the resistance to be expected in this circuit. You will
have to decide first whether the resistance of the ocean path connecting the
spheres is caused mainly by the region in the immediate vicinity of each sphere,
or by the large intervening volume of ocean. To clarify this question you might
consider the resistance between two concentric spheres, one much larger than
the other, with a homogeneous medium in between. Also, you might sketch
approximately the lines of current flow in the ocean between the spheres. This
question of the resistance of a circuit, part of which consists of a conducting
probe inserted into a poorly conducting medium, is important not only in
geophysics but also in many physiological investigations.

4.11 In the circuit at the right, if R0 is given, what value must R1 have in
order that the input resistance between the terminals shall be equal to R0?

4.12 When a battery of unknown voltage V but no internal resistance is
connected across a resistor R, an ammeter in the circuit reads 4 amperes.
When an additional 10-ohm resistor is placed in series with R, the current
reading falls to 3 amperes. What are the values of R and V? If the battery
did have an internal resistance R3, what set of experiments would give R, V
and R.-?

4.13 Show that if a battery of fixed emf 8 and internal resistance R, is
connected to a variable external resistance R, the maximum power is delivered
to the external resistor when R = R,-.

4.14 It is desired to supply heat at a very constant rate to some apparatus
inside a high-pressure cylinder. In the course of the experiment the pressure
will be changed and that will cause some change in the resistance of any wire
used as a heater. A simple circuit which helps a great deal in this situation
is shown in the figure. Resistor R3 is the heater coil mounted inside the pressure
cylinder. R1 and R2 are fixed resistors on the outside that can be counted
on to remain at constant value; V0 is the constant applied voltage. The idea
is to make the power dissipated in R3 independent of the resistance of R3, to
first order. That this must be possible can be seen from the following argu-
ment. If R3 approaches zero, the power dissipated in it must approach zero,
for the current is limited by R1. On the other hand, if R3 grows infinite, the
power also approaches zero for now the voltage across R3 is limited. Some-
where in between there must be a maximum. Your problem is to find it, that
is, to find the condition that R1, R2, and R3 must satisfy to achieve the desired
insensitivity to resistance change in R3.

4.15 In the bridge network illustrated the various resistances R1 \ldots R5 are
given, and the current 10 which flows in at the left and out at the right is given.
Solving this network consists in finding the currents in all the branches. These
five unknown currents have been arbitrarily assigned directions by the arrows
in the figure. If a current actually flows in the direction opposite to the arrow
in some branch, in a specific case, it will turn out to be a negative quantity.
For each of the four junctions, or nodes, an equation like 10 - I1 - I3 = 0
holds. Write these out and show that only three are independent. Obtain
two more equations by applying condition (iii), Sec. 4.8, to two loops. (Note
that three loops can be seen, but you will find that only two such loop equations
are independent.) You now have 5 independent equations in 5 unknowns and
the rest is algebraic crank-tuming. If you carry this through, a good way to
check your results is to let one or more of the R's go to zero, thereby reducing
the bridge to a simple circuit in which the partitioning of the currents is ob-
vious. For instance, what should you get for 11 if R5 = 0?

4.16 As an example of the point made in the first footnote in Sec. 4.8,
consider a ``black box'' which is approximately a 10-cm cube, with two binding
posts. Each of these terminals is connected by a wire to some external circuits.
Otherwise, the box is well insulated from everything. A current of approximately
one ampere flows through this circuit element. Suppose now that the
current in and the current out differ by one part in a million. About how long
would it take, unless something else happens, for the box to rise in potential
by 1000 volts?

4.17 Return to the example of the capacitor C discharging through the
resistor R which was worked out in the text and show that the total energy dissipated
in the resistor agrees with the energy originally stored in the capacitor.
Suppose someone objects that the capacitor is never really discharged because
Q only becomes zero for t = 00. How would you counter this objection? You
might find out how long it would take the charge to be reduced to one electron,
with some reasonable assumptions.

4.18 A small particle of graphite, roughly spherical and about 10 microns
(l0'3 cm) in diameter falls in vacuum through a beam of 3-kilovolt protons.
It had been shaken loose from a surface a few centimeters above the top edge
of the beam. The beam of horizontally moving protons carries a current of
10 mA spread uniformly over a circular cross section 2 cm in radius. You may
assume that a 3-kV proton cannot penetrate 10 microns of graphite, so that
any proton that hits the graphite stays in it. How much can you predict about
what will happen to the graphite particle? Here are some questions to think
about: How many protons would have to be caught by the particle to raise its
potential high enough to repel any further protons? Roughly how long would
this take? Longer than it would take the particle to fall through the beam?
Will the particle acquire any appreciable horizontal velocity? Will it get very
hot? Do you think such a proton beam, directed upward rather than hori-
zontally, could serve to support a graphite particle in vacuum? (Remark on
units: In this problem, and in most problems that one deals with in real-life
physics, one finds data given in a mixture of units. Some of the data will have
to be converted. Any consistent system will do; you may use one that seems
natural to the problem, one that requires the least conversion, or simply one
that you most easily remember. As we have recently been treating capacitance
in CGS units, consistent with charge in esu and potential in statvolts, a system
in which the unit of capacitance is the centimeter, you might use CGS units
for the discussion. That will require changing milliamperes to esu/sec and
remembering that 300 volts is one statvolt. Or you may equally well choose
work in practical electrical units, which will necessitate expressing the capacitance
of the particle in farads.)

4.19 One might be tempted to say that the speed of the charge carriers sets
a limit on the rapidity with which a charge distribution on a conductor can
readjust itself. However, consider an uncharged metal rod that suddenly has
1 esu of positive charge placed on one end and 1 esu of negative charge placed
on the other. How much actual motion of charge is required to make the rod
everywhere neutral again? Or consider this: a 10-Mev proton, the speed of
which you will easily find to be about 4.5 x 109 cm/sec, moves parallel to the
surface of a copper plate 1 mm away from the plate. The speed of the conduction
electrons in copper hardly exceeds 103 cm/sec. Do you think the
induced surface charge distribution can ``keep up'' with the motion of the
proton, or will it be left behind?

Chapter 5 The Fields of Moving Charges

5.1 From Oersted to Einstein

In the winter of 1819-20 Hans Christian Oersted was lecturing on
Electricity, Galvanism, and Magnetism to advanced students at the
University of Copenhagen. Electricity meant electrostatics; galvanism
referred to the effects produced by continuous currents from
batteries, a subject opened up by Galvani's chance discovery and the
subsequent experiments of Volta; magnetism dealt with the already
ancient lore of lodestones, compass needles, and the terrestrial magnetic
field. It seemed clear to some that there must be a relation between
galvanic currents and electric charge, although there was little
more direct evidence than the fact that both could cause shocks. On
the other hand, magnetism and electricity appeared to have nothing
whatever to do with one another. Still, Oersted had a notion, vague
perhaps, but tenaciously pursued, that magnetism like the galvanic
current might be a sort of ``hidden form'' of electricity. Groping for
some manifestation of this, he tried before his class the experiment
of passing a galvanic current through a wire which ran above and at
right angles to a compass needle. It had no effect. After the lecture,
something impelled him to try the experiment with a wire running
parallel to the compass needle. The needle swung wide---and when
the galvanic current was reversed it swung the other way!

The scientific world was more than ready for this revelation. A
ferment of experimentation and discovery followed as soon as the
word reached other laboratories. Before long Ampere, Faraday, and
others had worked out an essentially complete and exact description
of the magnetic action of electric currents. Faraday's crowning discovery
of electromagnetic induction came less than 12 years after
Oersted's experiment. In the previous two centuries since the publication
in 1600 of William Gilbert's great work De Magnete, man's
understanding of magnetism had advanced not at all. Out of these
experimental discoveries there grew the complete classical theory of
electromagnetism. Formulated mathematically by Maxwell, it was
triumphantly corroborated by Hertz's demonstration of electromagnetic
waves in 1888.

Special relativity has its historical roots in electromagnetism.
Lorentz, exploring the electrodynamics of moving charges, was led
very close to the final formulation of Einstein. And Einstein's great
paper of 1905 was entitled not ``Theory of Relativity,'' but rather ``On

148

% p. 149
the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies.'' Today we see in the
postulates of relativity and their implications a wide framework, one
that embraces all physical laws and not solely those of electromag-
netism. We expect any complete physical theory to be relativistically
invariant. It ought to tell the same story in all inertial frames of
reference. As it happened, physics already had one relativistically
invariant theory---Maxwell's electromagnetic theory---long before
the significance of relativistic invariance was recognized. Whether
the ideas of special relativity could have evolved in the absence of a
complete theory of the electromagnetic field is a question for the
historian of science to speculate about; probably it can't be answered.
We can only say that the actual history shows rather plainly a path
running from Oersted's compass needle to Einstein's postulates.

In this chapter and Chap. 6 we are going to follow that path almost
in reverse. This implies no disrespect for history. Indeed, we think
a student of the history of those magnificent discoveries will not be
handicapped by a clear view of the essential relation between electricity
and magnetism. That relation can be exposed very directly
and simply by looking, in the light of special relativity, at what we
have already learned about electric charge and the electric field.

Before we do that, let's review some of the phenomena we shall be
trying to explain.

5.2 Magnetic Forces

Two wires running parallel to one another and carrying currents
in the same direction are drawn together. The force on one of the
wires, per unit length of wire, proves to be proportional to the product
of the two currents and inversely proportional to the distance between
the wires (Fig. 5.1a). Reversing the direction of one of the
currents changes the force to one of repulsion. Thus the two sections
of wire in Fig. 5.119 which are part of the same circuit tend to ffy apart.
There is some sort of ``action-at-a-distance'' between the two filaments
of steady electric current. It seems to have nothing to do with
any static electric charge on the surface of the wire. There may be
some such charge and the wires may be at different potentials, but
the force we are concerned with depends only on the charge movement
in the wires, that is, on the two currents. You can put a sheet
of metal between the two wires without affecting this force at all

(Fig. 5.1c). These new forces that come into play when charges are
moving are called magnetic.

% p. 150
 

Oersted's compass needle (Fig. 5.2a) doesn't look much like a
direct-current circuit. We now know, however, as Ampere was the
first to suspect, that magnetized iron is full of perpetually moving
charges---electric currents on an atomic scale. A slender coil of wire
with a battery to drive current through it (Fig. 5.2b) behaves just
like the compass needle under the influence of a nearby current.

Observing the motion of a free charged particle, instead of awire
carrying current, we find the same thing happening. In a cathode-ray
tube, electrons that would otherwise follow a straight path are de-
ffected toward or away from an external current-carrying wire, depending
on the relative direction of the current in that wire (Fig. 5.3).
You are already familiar with this from the laboratory, and you know
that this interaction of currents and other moving charges can be
described by introducing a magnetic field. (The electric field,
remember, was simply a way of describing the ``action-at-a-distance''
between stationary charges that is expressed in Coulomb's law.)
We say that an electric current has associated with it a magnetic field
which pervades the surrounding space. Some other current, or any
moving charged particle which finds itself in this field, experiences a
force proportional to the strength of the magnetic field in that
locality. The force is always perpendicular to the velocity, for a
charged particle. The entire force on a particle carrying charge q is
given by

qv><B (1)

where B is the magnetic field.

% p. 151
We shall take Eq. 1 as the definition of B. The magnetic field
strength is a vector which determines the Velocity-proportional part
of the force on a moving charge. In other words, the command,
``Measure the direction and magnitude of the vector B at such and
such a place,'' calls for the following operations: Take aparticle of
known charge q. Measure the force on q at rest, to determine E.
Then measure the force on the particle when its velocity is v; repeat
with v in some other direction. Now find a B that will make Eq. 1
fit all these results; that is the magnetic field at the place in question.

Clearly this doesn't explain anything. Why does Eq. 1 work?
Why can we always find a B that is consistent with this simple rela-
tion, for all possible velocities? We want to understand why there
is a Velocity-proportional force. It is really most remarkable that
this force is strictly proportional to v, and that the effect of the electric

field does not depend on v at all! In the following pages we'll see
how this comes about.

5.3 Measurement of Charge in Motion

How are we going to measure the quantity of electric charge on a
moving particle? Until this question is settled, it is pointless to ask
what effect motion has on charge itself. A charge can only be measured
by the effects it produces. A point charge Q which is at rest can
be measured by determining the force that acts on a test charge q a
certain distance away (Fig. 5.4a). That is based on Coulomb's law.
But if the charge we want to measure is moving, we are on uncertain
ground. There is now a special direction in space, the instantaneous
direction of motion. It could be that the force on the test charge q
depends on the direction from Q to q, as well as on the distance between
the two charges. For different positions of the test charge, as
in Fig. 5.41:, we would observe different forces. Putting these into
Coulomb's Law would lead to different values for the same quantity
Q. Also we have as yet no assurance that the force will always
be in the direction of the radius vector 1'.

To allow for this possibility, let's agree to define Q by averaging
over all directions. Imagine a large number of infinitesimal test
charges distributed evenly over a sphere (Fig. 5.4c). At the instant
the moving charge passes the center of the sphere, the radial component
of force on each test charge is measured, and the average of these
force magnitudes is used to compute Q. Now this is just the opera-

% p. 152
tion that would be needed to determine the surface integral of the
electric field over that sphere, at time t. The test charges here are all
at rest, remember; the force on q per unit charge gives, by definition,
the electric field at that point. This suggests that Gauss's law, rather
than Coulomb's law, offers the natural way' to define quantity of
charge for a moving charged particle, or for a collection of moving
charges. We can frame such a definition as follows.

The amount of electric charge in a region is defined by the surface
integral of the electric field E over a surface S enclosing the region.
This surface S is fixed in some coordinate frame F. The field E is
measured, at any point (x,y,z) and at time t in F, by the force on a
test charge at rest in F, at that time and place. The surface integral
is to be determined for a particular time t. That is, the field values
used are those measured simultaneously by observers deployed all
over S. (This presents no difficulty, for S is stationary in the frame F.)
Let us denote such a surface integral, over S at time t, by

s(nE ' da (2)

We define the amount of charge inside S as 1/477 times this integral:

1
9 = 4-,.  <3>

It would be embarrassing if the value of Q so determined depended
on the size and shape of the surface S. For a stationary charge it
doesn't---that is Gauss's law. But how do we know that Gauss's law
holds when charges are moving? Fortunately it does. We can take
that as an experimental fact. This fundamental property of the
electric field of moving charges permits us to define quantity of
charge by Eq. 3. From now on we can speak of the amount of charge
in a region or on a particle, and that will have a perfectly definite
meaning even if the charge is in motion.

Figure 5.5 summarizes these points in an example. Two protons
and two electrons are shown in motion, at a particular instant of
time. It is a fact that the surface integral of the electric field E over
the surface S1 is precisely equal to the surface integral over S2
evaluated at the same instant, and we may use this integral, as we

Ht is not the only possible way. You could, for instance, adopt the arbitrary rule that
the test charge must always be placed directly ahead (in the direction of motion) of the
charge to be measured. Charge so defined would not have the simple properties we are
about to discuss, and your theory would prove clumsy and complicated.

% p. 153
always have used Gauss's law in electrostatics, to determine the total
charge enclosed. Figure 5.6 raises a new question. What if the
same particles had some other velocities? For instance, suppose the
two protons and two electrons combine to form a hydrogen molecule.
Will the total charge appear exactly the same as before?

5.4 Invariance of Charge

There is conclusive experimental evidence that the total charge in
a system is not changed by the motion of the charge carriers. We
are so accustomed to taking this for granted that we seldom pause
to think how remarkable and fundamental a fact it is. For proof,
we can point to the exact electrical neutrality of atoms and molecules.
We have already described in Chap. 1 the experimental test of the
neutrality of the hydrogen molecule which proved that the electron
and proton carry charges equal in magnitude to better than 1 part
in 1020. A similar experiment was performed with helium atoms.
Now the helium atom contains two protons and two electrons, the
same charged particles that make up the hydrogen molecule. In the
helium atom their motion is very different. The protons, in par-
ticular, instead of revolving slowly 0.7 angstroms apart, are tightly
bound into the helium nucleus where they move with kinetic energies
in the range of a million electron volts. If motion had any effect on
the amount of charge, we could not have exact cancellation of nuclear
and electronic charge in both the hydrogen molecule and the helium
atom. In fact, the helium atom was shown to be neutral with nearly
the same experimental accuracy.

Another line of evidence comes from the optical spectra of isotopes
of the same element, atoms with different nuclear masses but,
nominally at least, the same nuclear charge. Here again we find a
marked difference in the motion of the protons within the nucleus,
but comparison of the spectral lines of the two species shows no discrepancy
that could be attributed to even a slight difference in total
nuclear charge.

Mass is not invariant in the same way. We know that the mass of
a particle is changed by its motion, by the factor l/(1 - U2/c2)1/2.
To emphasize the difference, we show in Fig. 5.7 an imaginary ex-
periment. In the box on the right the two massive charged particles,
which are fastened to the end of a pivoted rod, have been set revolving
with speed v. The entire mass on the right is greater than the
mass on the left, as demonstrated by weighing the box on a spring

% p. 154
balance or by measuring the force required to accelerate it.T The
total electric charge, however, is unchanged. A real experiment
equivalent to this can be carried out with a mass spectrograph, which
can reveal quite plainly a mass difference between an ionized deuterium
molecule (2 protons, 2 neutrons, 1 electron) and an ionized
helium atom (also 2 protons, 2 neutrons, and 1 electron). These are
two very different structures, in which the component particles are
moving with very different speeds. The difference in energy shows
up as a measurable difference in mass. There is no detectable dif-
ference, to very high precision, in the electric charge of the two ions.

'i'The difference in mass depends not only on the kinetic energy of the particles but
also on any change in potential energy as in the elastic strain in the rod that holds the
particles. If the rod is fairly stiff, this contribution will be small compared to the v2/c2
term. See if you can show why.

% p. 155
This invariance of charge lends a special significance to the fact of
charge quantization. We emphasized in Chap. 1 the importance-
and the mystery---of the fact that every elementary charged particle
has a charge equal in magnitude to that of every other such particle.
We now observe that this precise equality holds not only for two
particles at rest with respect to one another, but for any state of relative
motion.

The experiments we have described, and many others, show that
the value of our Gauss's law surface integral LE - da depends only on

the number and variety of charged particles inside S, and not on how
they are moving. According to the postulate of relativity, such a
statement must be true for any inertial frame of reference if it is true
for one. Therefore if F' is some other inertial frame, moving with
respect to F, and if S' is a closed surface in that frame which at time t'

encloses the same charged bodies that were enclosed by S at time t,
we must have

fs(nE ' da = s'<r>E, ' da' (4)

The field E' is of course measured in F', that is, it is defined by the
force on a test charge at rest in F'. The distinction between t and t'
must not be overlooked. As we know, events that are simultaneous
in F need not be simultaneous in F'. Each of the surface integrals in
Eq. 4 is to be evaluated at one instant in its frame. If charges lie on
the boundary of S, or of S', one has to be rather careful about ascertaining
that the charges within S at t are the same as those within S'
at t'. If the charges are well away from the boundary, as in Fig. 5.8
which is intended to illustrate the relation in Eq. 4, there is no prob-
1cm in this respect.

Equation 4 is a formal statement of the relativistic invariance of
charge. We can choose our Gaussian surface in any inertial frame;
the surface integral will give a number independent of the frame.
This is not the same as charge conservation, which was discussed in
Chap. 4 and expressed mathematically in the equation

at

Charge conservation implies that if we take a closed surface fixed in
some coordinate system, containing some charged matter, and if no
particles cross the boundary, then the total charge inside that surface

% p. 156
remains constant. Charge invariance implies that if we look at this
collection of stuff from any other frame of reference we will measure
exactly the same amount of charge. Energy is conserved, but energy
is not a relativistic invariant. Charge is conserved and charge is a
relativistic invariant. In the language of relativity theory, energy is
one component of a four-vector, while charge is a scalar, an invariant
number, with respect to the Lorentz transformation. This is an observed
fact with far-reaching implications. It completely determines
the nature of the field of moving charges.

5.5 Electric Field Measured in different Frames of Reference

If charge is to be invariant under a Lorentz transformation, the
electric field E has to transform in a particular way. ``Transform-
ing E'' means answering a question like this: If an observer in a certain
inertial frame F measures an electric field E as so-and-so-many
statvolts/cm, at a given point in space and time, what field will be
measured at the same space-time point by an observer in a different
inertial frame F'? For a certain class of fields, we can answer this
question by applying Gauss's law to some simple systems.

In the frame F (Fig. 5.9a) there are two stationary sheets of charge
of uniform density +0 and -a esu/cm2, respectively. They are
squares 19 cm on a side lying parallel to the xy plane, and their separation
is supposed to be so small compared to their extent that the field
between them can be treated as uniform. The magnitude of this
field, as measured by an observer in F, is of course just 47m. Now
consider an inertial frame F' which moves toward the left, with
respect to F, with velocity v. To an observer in F', the charged
``squares'' are no longer square. Their x' dimension is contracted
from 19 to bx/l - [32, where ,8 stands for 12/0, as usual. But total
charge is invariant, that is, independent of reference frame, so the
charge density measured in F', is greater than a in the ratio 1/ \/l - B2.
Figure 5.9 shows the system in cross section, (19) as seen in F and (c)
as seen in F'. What can we say about the electric field in F', if all
we know about the electric field of moving charges is contained in
Eq. 4?

For one thing, we can be sure that the electric field is zero outside
the sandwich, and uniform between the sheets, at least in the limit
as the extent of the sheets becomes infinite. The field of an infinite
uniform sheet could not depend on the distance from the sheet, nor
on position along the sheet. (There is nothing in the system to fix

a distance scale or a position; if the field varied according to a power
law like the field of a point or line charge, it would be infinite at the
sheet.) However, for all we know now,T the field of a single moving
sheet of positive charge could look like Fig. 5.9d. But if it did, the
field of a sheet of negative charge would have to look like Fig. 5.9e,
so the superposition of the two would still give a field of the character
indicated in Fig. 5.9f.

We can apply Gauss's law to a box stationary in frame F', the box
shown in cross section in Fig. 5.9f. The charge content is determined
by a', and the field is zero outside the sandwich. Gauss's law tells us
that the magnitude of E,', which is the only field component inside,

must be 4770', or 47m/\/1 - B2.

(For the factor 1/ \/l - B2 we shall often use the symbol y, introduced
in Vol. 1, Chap. 11, Eq. 13. It saves a lot of writing. Remem-
ber, y 2 1, always.)

Now imagine a different situation with the stationary charged
sheets in the frame F oriented perpendicular to the x axis, as in
Fig. 5.10. The observer in F now reports a field in the x direction of
magnitude E, = 4770. In this case, the surface charge density observed
in the frame F' is the same as that observed in F. The sheets
are not contracted; only the distance between them is contracted, but
that doesn't enter into the determination of the field. This time we
find by applying Gauss's law to the box stationary in F':

E2' = (5)

E,' = 47m' = 4770 : E, (6)

That is all very well for the particularly simple arrangement of
charges here pictured; do our conclusions have more general validity?
This question takes us to the heart of the meaning of field. If the
electric field E at a point in space-time is to have a unique meaning,
then the way E appears in other frames of reference, in the same
space-time neighborhood, cannot depend on the nature of the
sources, wherever they may be, that produced E. In other words,
the observer in F, having measured the field in his neighborhood at
some time, ought to be able to predict from these measurements alone
what observers in other frames of reference would measure at the

T Remember this is a moving sheet of charge, in F'; we have as yet no guarantee that

its field will be like that of a stationary sheet. In fact, as it turns out, the electric field
of a moving sheet of charge is nernendicnlar tn the sheet, unlike the hvnothetical fields

same space-time point. Were this not true, field would be a useless
concept. The evidence that it is true is the eventual agreement of
our field theory with experiment.

Seen in this light, the relations expressed in Eqs. 5 and 6 take on
a significance beyond the special case of charges on parallel sheets.
Consider any charge distribution all parts of which are at rest with
respect to the frame F. If an observer in F measures a field E2 in the
z direction, then an observer in the frame F' will report, for the same
space-time point, a field E; = yEz. That is, he will get a number, as
the result of his E; measurement, which is larger by the factor y than
the number the F observer got in his E2 measurement. On the
other hand, if the observer in F measures a field E, in the x direction,
the direction of the velocity of F' with respect to F, then the observer
in F' reports a field E; equal to E,. Obviously the y and the z directions
are equivalent, both being transverse to the velocity v. Any-
thing we have said about E; applies to E,', too. Whatever the direction
of E in the frame F, we can treat it as a superposition of fields in
the x, the y, and the z directions, and from the transformation of each
of these predict the vector field E' at that point in F'. Let's summarize
this in words appropriate to relative motion in any direction:
Charges at rest in frame F are the source of a field E. Let frame F'
move with speed v relative to F. At any point in F, resolve E into a
"longitudinal" component E" parallel to v and a transverse component
E L perpendicular to the direction of v. At the same space-time
point in F', the field E' is to be resolved into El and EL, E( being
parallel to v and E1 perpendicular thereto. We have learned that

(7)

 

Our conclusion holds only for fields that arise from charges stationary
in F. As we shall see presently, if charges in F are moving, the prediction
of the electric field in F' involves knowledge of two fields in F,
the electric and the magnetic. But we already have a useful result,
one that suffices whenever we can find any inertial frame of reference
in which all the charges remain at rest. We shall use it now to study
the electric field of a point charge moving with constant velocity.

5.6 Field of a Point Charge Moving with Constant Velocity
In the frame F the point charge Q remains at rest at the origin
(Fig. 5.1la). At every point the electric field E has the magnitude

% p. 159
 

Q/r2 and is directed radially outward. In the xz plane its components
at any point (x,z) are

_ Q _ Qx
E' ' ,2 cos 0 ' (x2 + z2)3/2
Q Q (8)
. z
E, = r-2 sm 0 = (x2 + z2)3/2

Let the frame F' move in the negative x direction, with speed 12. The
relations between the coordinates of an event, or space-time point,
in the two frames are

x=y(x'-,Bct') y=g' z=z' t=y(r_Ec"i) (9)

This is the Lorentz transformation given in Eq. 15 of Chap. 11, Vol.1.
We have minus signs in our equations above because our frame F' is
moving in the negative x direction, seen from F. The clocks have
been set to read zero when x': O and x' = 0 coincide.

According to Eqs. 5 and 6, E; = 'yE, and E,' = E,,. Using Eqs. 8
and 9, we can express the field components E; and E; in terms of the

coordinates in F '. For the instant t' = 0, when Q passes the origin
in F ', we have:

E; = E: = L
 + z'2]3/2

% p. 160
Note first that E;/E,' = z' / x'. This tells us that the vector E' makes
the same angle with the x' axis as does the radius vector r'. Hence
E' points radially outward along a line drawn from the instantaneous
position of Q, as in Fig. 5.1lb. Pause a moment to let this conclusion
sink in! It means that if Q passed the origin of the primed system at
precisely 12:00 noon, ``prime time,'' an observer stationed anywhere
in the primed system will report that the electric field in his vicinity
was pointing, at 12:00 noon, exactly radially from the origin. This
sounds at first like instantaneous transmission of information! How
can an observer a mile away know where the particle is at the same
instant? He can't. That wasn't implied. This particle, remember,
has been moving at constant speed forever, on a ``flight plan'' that
calls for it to pass the origin at noon. That information has been
available for a long time. It is the past history of the particle that
determined the field observed, if you want to talk about cause and
effect. We'1l inquire presently into what happens when there is an
unscheduled change in the flight plan.

To find the strength of the field, we compute E;2 + Egz, which is
the square of the magnitude of the field, E'2.

(Here, for once, it was neater with ,8 worked back into the expres-
sion.) Let 1' denote the distance from the charge Q, which is
momentarily at the origin, to the point (x',z') where the field is
measured: 1' = (x'2 + z'2)1/2. Let 0' denote the angle between this
radius vector and the velocity of the charge Q, which is moving in
the positive x' direction in the frame F'. Then since z' = 1' sin 0', the
magnitude of the field can be written as:

I 1- 2
E  (12)

There is nothing special about the origin of coordinates, nor about
the x'z' plane as compared to any other plane through the x' axis.
Therefore we can say quite generally that the electric field of a charge
in uniform motion, at a given instant of time, is directed radially from
the instantaneous position of the charge, while its magnitude is given
by Eq. 12 with 0' the angle between the direction of motion of the

this instant, the charge is passing the origin

charge and the radius vector from the instantaneous position of the
charge to the point of observation.

For low speeds the field reduces simply to E' : Q/i' 2, and is practically
the same, at any instant, as the field of a point charge stationary
in F' at the instantaneous location of Q. But if ,8? is not
negligible, the field is stronger at right angles to the motion than in
the direction of the motion, at the same distance from the charge.
If we were to indicate the intensity of the field by the density of field
lines, as is often done, the lines tend to concentrate in a pancake
perpendicular to the direction of motion. Figure 5.12 shows the
density of lines as they pass through a unit sphere, from a charge
moving in the x' direction with a speed 0/0 = 0.866. A simpler representation
of the field is shown in Fig. 5.13, a cross section through
the field with some field lines in the x'z' plane indicated.i'

This is a remarkable electric field. It is not spherically symmet-
rical, which is not surprising because in this frame there is a preferred
direction, the direction of motion of the charge. Also, it is a field
that no stationary charge distribution, whatever its form, could pro-
duce. For in this field the line integral of E' is not zero around every
closed path. Consider, for example, the closed path ABCD in
Fig. 5.13. The circular arcs contribute nothing to the line integral,
being perpendicular to the field; on the radial sections, the field is
stronger along BC than along DA, so the circulation of E' on this path
is not zero. But remember, this is not an electrostatic field. In the

TA twodimensional diagram like Fig. 5.13 cannot faithfully represent the field intensity
by the density of field lines. Unless we arbitrarily break off some of the lines,
the density of lines in the picture will fall off as 1/1', whereas the intensity of the field
we are trying to represent falls ofi" as 1/1". So Fig. 5.13 gives only a qualitative in-

 

% p. 162

course of time the electric field E' at any point in the frame F' changes
as the source charge moves.

Figures 5.14 and 5.15 show the electric field at certain instants of
time observed in a frame of reference through which an electron is
moving at constant velocity in the x direction.T In Fig. 5.14, the
speed of the electron is 0.330, its kinetic energy therefore (Vol. 1,
Chap. 12) about 30,000 electron-volts (30 keV). The value of ,8?
is 13 and the electric field does not differ greatly from that of a charge
at rest. In Fig. 5.15, the speed is 0.80, corresponding to a kinetic
energy of 335 keV. If the time unit for each diagram is taken as
1.0 X 10'10 see, the distance scale is life-size, as drawn. Of course,
the diagram holds equally well for any charged particle moving at
the specified fraction of the speed of light. We mention the equivalent
energies for an electron merely to remind the reader that relativistic
speeds are nothing out of the ordinary in the laboratory.

5.7 Field of a Charge That Starts or Stops

It must be clearly understood that uniform velocity, as we have
been using the term, implies a motion at constant speed in a straight
line that has been going on forever. What if our electron had not
been traveling in the distant past along the negative x axis until it
came into view in our diagram at t = 0? Suppose it had been sitting
quietly at rest at the origin, waiting for the clock to read t = 0. Just
prior to t = 0, something gives the electron a sudden large accelera-
tion, up to the speed v, and it moves away along the positive x axis
at this speed. Its motion from then on precisely duplicates the motion
of the electron for which Fig. 5.15 was drawn. But Fig. 5.15
does not correctly represent the field of the electron whose history
was just described. To see that it cannot do so, consider the field at
the point marked P, at time t = 2, which means 2 X 10'10 sec. In
2 x 10-10 see a light signal travels 6 cm. Since this point lies more
than 6 cm distant from the origin, it could not have received the news
that the electron had startedto move at t = 0! Unless there is a
gross violation of relativity---and we are taking the postulates of
relativity as basis for this whole discussion---the field at the point P
at time t = 2, and indeed at all points outside the sphere of radius

6 cm centered on the origin, must be the field of a charge at rest at the
origin.

T Previously we had the charge at rest in the unprimed frame, moving in the primed

frame. Here we adopt xyz for the frame in which the charge is moving, to avoid cluttering
the subsequent discussion with primes.

% p. 164
 

W

On the other hand, close to the moving charge itself, what happened
in the remote past can't make any difference. The field must
somehow change, as we consider regions farther and farther from
the charge, at the given instant t = 2, from the field shown in the
second diagram of Fig. 5.15 to the field of a charge at the origin. We
can't deduce more than this without knowing how fast the news does
travel. Suppose---just suppose---it travels as fast as it can without
confficting with the relativity postulates. Then if the period of acceleration
is neglected, we should expect the field within the entire
6-cm-radius sphere, at t = 2, to be the field of a uniformly moving
point charge. If that is so, the field of the electron which starts from
rest, suddenly acquiring the speed 12 at t = 0, must look something
like Fig. 5.16. There is a thin spherical shell (whose thickness in an
actual case will depend on the duration of the interval required for
acceleration) within which the transition from one type of field to
the other takes place. This shell simply expands with speed c, its
center remaining at x = 0. The arrowheads on the field lines indicate
the direction of the field when the source is a negative charge
as we have been assuming.

Figure 5.17 shows the field of an electron which had been moving
with uniform velocity until t = 0, at which time it reached x = 0
where it was abruptly stopped. Now the news that it was stopped

% p. 165
  

cannot reach, by time t, any point farther than ct from the origin.
The field outside the sphere of radius R = ct must be that which
would have prevailed if the electron had kept on moving at its original
speed. That is why we see the ``brush'' of field lines on the right
in Fig. 5.17 pointing precisely down to the position where the electron
would be if it hadn't stopped. (Note that this last conclusion
does not depend on the assumption we introduced in the previous
paragraph, that the news travels as fast as it can.) The field almost
seems to have a life of its own!

It is a relatively simple matter to connect up the inner and outer
field lines. There is only one way it can be done that is consistent
with Gauss's law. Taking Fig. 5.17 as an example, from some point
such as A on the radial field line making angle 00 with the x axis,
follow the field line wherever it may lead until you emerge in the
outer field on some line making an angle that we may call (pg with
the x axis. (This line of course is radial from the extrapolated position
of the charge, the apparent source of the outer field.) Connect
A and D to the x axis by circular arcs, arc AE centered on the source
of the inner field, arc DF centered on the apparent source of the
outer field. Rotate the curve EABCDF around the x axis to generate
a surface of revolution. As the surface encloses no charge, the surface
integral of E over the entire surface must be zero. The only

% p. 166
 

contributions to the integral come from the spherical caps, for the
rest of the surface generated by ABCD is parallel to the field by the
very mode of its construction. The field over the inner cap is the
field of a point charge at rest; the field over the outer cap is the field
of a point charge with constant speed 0, as given by Eq. 12. Let us
calculate the flux through the inner cap, shown in Fig. 5.18. The
integral of E over this cap is:

_f()0°rl22wr2sin0d0 = 27rq Laosinfidff (13)
The integral of E over the outer cap is:

The condition that the flux in at the left equal the flux out at the
right is therefore:

90 . 'Po 1-32 .

You can work this out as an exercise in integration? It yields the
following relation between 90 and (p0:

% p. 167
An equivalent, and simpler, way of expressing the same relation is:
tan (P0 = ytan 00 (17)

Incidentally, this relation between 00 and cpo, based on the inclusion
of equal amounts of flux, is the same as the relation between the
angles that a rigid rod makes with the direction of relative motion,
in its rest frame and in the moving frame. This allows us to picture
the transformation to the field of a moving charge in a very simple
way: Let each ``line'' represent a certain amount of flux, and imagine
the lines in the rest frame of the charge as fixed rods sticking out in
all directions. In the moving frame, each rod represents the same
amount of flux, and the rods now appear at steeper angles, so that
the cluster of rods looks like Fig. 5.13.

It is only the width of the transition region in Fig. 5.17 that depends
on our as-yet-unsupported assumption that ``the news travels
as fast as it can.'' The connection expressed in Eq. 17 must hold if
there is any region close to the charge now at rest from which traces
of its history before t = 0 have vanished. Therefore in the field lines
that connect the near field to the remote field, there must be a trans-
verse, that is, nonradial, component.

The field lines in Figs. 5.16 and 5.17 were connected so as to conform
to the requirement of Eq. 17. The result is a rather intense
field in the transition region, with the field there running mainly perpendicular
to the radius vector from the origin. Remembering that
this field configuration expands with speed c as time goes on, we see
that we have something very much like an outgoing wave of transverse
electric field---transverse to the direction of propagation, that is.

We were led to this by following through consistently the consequences
of the relativity postulates and the observed fact that electric
charge is a relativistic invariant. We shall be able to use these ideas
later to understand the nature of the radiation from an accelerated
charge. First, however, we must return to the uniformly moving
charge, which has more surprises in store.

5.8 Force on a Moving Charge

Equation 12 tells us the force experienced by a stationary charge
in the field of another charge that is moving at constant velocity.
We now ask a different question: What is the force that acts on a
moving charge. one that moves in the field of some other charges?

% p. 168
We shall look first into the case of a charge moving through the field
produced by stationary charges. It might be an electron moving
between the charged plates of an oscilloscope, or an alpha particle
moving through the Coulomb field around an atomic nucleus. The
sources of the field, in any case, are all at rest in some frame of reference
which we shall call the ``lab.'' At some place and time in the
``lab'' frame we observe a particle carrying charge q which is moving,
at that instant, with velocity v through the electrostatic field. What
force appears to act on q?

Force is only a name for rate-of-change-of-momenturn, so we are
really asking, what is the rate of change of momentum of the particle,
dp/dt, at this place and time, as measured in our ``lab'' frame of ref-
erence? (That is all we mean by the force on a moving particle.)
The answer is contained, by implication, in what we have already
learned. Let's look at the system from a coordinate frame F' moving,
at the time in question, along with the particle. In this ``particle''
frame the particle will be, at least momentarily, at rest. It is the
other charges that are now moving. This is a situation we know
how to handle. The force on the stationary charge q is just E'q where
E' is the electric field observed in the frame F'. Then we know how
to find E' when E is given; Eq. 7 provides our rule. Thus knowing
E, we can find the rate of change of momentum of the particle as
observed in F'. All that remains is to transform this quantity back
to F. So our problem hinges on the question, how does force, that
is, rate of change of momentum, transform from one inertial frame
to another?

That question was studied in Vol. 1, Chap. 12. You may remember
how it came out. However, instead of lifting the appropriate formulas
from Vol. I, we are going to review here some steps which lead
to them. This will help us to understand exactly what is going on.
Consider, then, any inertial frame F 'moving in the positive x direction
with speed 0 as observed in another frame F. In F', let a particle
of rest mass m be moving in the positive x' direction with speed v'.
Use p, to denote the x component of momentum (measured in F)

and p,' to denote the x' component of momentum (measured in F').
To find the relation between p, and p_,' we note that

I

;=_____= " w

Here we have used the obvious abbreviations, B' = u'/c and

y=um-az

% p. 169
In the frame F, on the other hand, the speed of the particle is
(u + u')/(1 + vv'/c2) which can be written c(,B + ,8')/(1 + BB'),
50 that

W : mc(B + ,8') = mc(B + ,8')

(1 + BB,)[1_(1BJ;+B.l:;,) J [(1 .3 )(1 .3 )1'
= mm/(B + .3') (19)

)n comparing Eq. 18 with Eq. 19, we find that p, is related to p,' as
bllows:

p1 = 7(1); + /3Y'mC) (20)

We note that in the term ,8y'mc, the part y'mc is y'mc2/c, or E'/c
/here E ' (not to be confused with the electric field in which we have
amporarily lost interest!) is the total energy, rest plus kinetic, of the
article in F'. Let us write Eq. 20 this way, p, = y(p,' + BE'/c), and
ause brieffy to compare it with the Lorentz transformation of the
oordinate x in the same situation: x = y(x' + ,8ct'). The similarity
zminds us of a general fact: in a Lorentz transformation the four
uantities p,, p,,, P24, and E/c behave exactly like the four space~time
aordinates, x, y, z, and at. Indeed, if you were firmly in command
f that fact you could have written Eq. 20 down directly and yomare
ntitled to regard our little review as a waste of time. Let's use the
[Ct as a substitute for a derivation for the transverse momentum
)mponents. Since y = y' in a Lorentz transformation with
directed relative velocity, we must expect that

Pa = Pu' (21)

The relation between t and t' is given by the familiar formula:

_c__

t: y(r + Bx') (22)

tiating Eq. 22, we get:

)dt" = ydr(1+ BB') (23)

ice dx'/dt' is simply v'. Equation 21 gives us

dm = dry' (24)

% p. 170
and differentiating Eq. 20 gives

dm = yap; + yBm(j*',)dp; <25)

1'

In this last expression the factor mc(dy'/dpg) can be evaluated from
Eq. 18, which says that

Pr' = moi/B' = m0\/Y'2 - 1 (26)

Thus
dp,' _ mcy' _ Lo 27
dv" y'2-1'/3* "
Then dyl = TL = 'B/ and putting this into Eq. 25 we get
dpé (dp;/dv') mo
dm = v dp;<1 + BB') (28)
Comparing Eqs. 23 and 28 we see that
d .z' d z'
5; = 2:, <2»

and this holds no matter how large 1)' is since the factor (1 + /3,8')
appeared in both equations. Actually, we shall be interested only in
situations where v' is very small---that is, where the particle is very
nearly at rest in the F' frame. In that case the term BB' can be neglected
and if we then compare Eqs. 23 and 24, we find, for the transverse
momentum change:

dpv : L dpl;
dt y dt'

(30)

Summarizing the important results: F' is an inertial frame in
which a particle is instantaneously at rest or moving very slowly. F is
any other inertial frame with respect to which F' is moving with any
speed whatever. Using H and _L to label momentum components

respectively parallel to and transverse to the relative velocity of F'
and F, we can state that

(31)

 

Equipped with the force transformation law, Eq. 31, and the transformation
law for the electric field, Eq. 7, we return now to our

% p. 171
charged particle moving through the field E, and we discover an
astonishingly simple fact. Consider first E", the component of E
parallel to the instantaneous direction of motion of our charged
particle. Transform to a frame F' moving, at that instant, with the
particle. In that frame the longitudinal electric field is Efi, and
according to Eq. 7, EN' = E". So the force dpfi /dt' is

d ' ,

dig': = E.q = qE». (32)
Back in frame F, observers are measuring the longitudinal force, that
is, the rate of change of the longitudinal momentum component,

dpu/df. According to Eq. 31, dp"/dt : dpll/dt', so in frame F the
longitudinal force component they find is:

d d '
72¢ = d";'l = GEN (33)

Of course the particle does not remain at rest in F' as time goes on.
It will be accelerated by the field E', and v', the velocity of the particle
in the inertial frame F', will gradually increase from zero. However,
as we are concerned with the instantaneous acceleration, only
infinitesimal values of v' are involved anyway, and the restriction
on Eq. 31 is rigorously fulfilled. For E L, the transverse field component
in F, the transformation is E' = yEi, so that (dpl/dt') =
qEi = qyEi. But on transforming the force back to frame F we have
(dpi/dt) = (1/7) (dpi/dt') so the 7 drops out after all:

% = §(vEiq) = qEl (34)
The message of Eqs. 33 and 34 is simply this: the force acting on a
charged particle in motion through F is q times the electric field E in
that frame, strictly independent of the velocity of the particle.
Figure 5.19 is a reminder of this fact, and of the way we discovered it.

You have already used this result earlier in the course, where you
were simply told that the contribution of the electric field to the force
on a moving charge is qE. Because this is familiar and so simple, you
may think it is obvious and we have been wasting our time proving it.
Now we could have taken it as an empirical fact. It has been verified
over an enormous range, up to velocities so close to the speed of light,
in the case of electrons, that the factor 7 is 104. From that point of
view it is a most remarkable law. Our discussion in this chapter has
shown it to be a direct consequence of charge invariance.

5.9 Interaction between a Moving Charge and
Other Moving Charges

We know that there can be a velocity-dependent force on a moving
charge. That force is associated with a magnetic field, the sources of
which are electric currents, that is, other charges in motion.
Oersted's experiment showed that electric currents could influence
magnets, but at that time the nature of a magnet was totally
mysterious. Soon Ampere and others unraveled the interaction of
electric currents with each other, as in the attraction observed between
two parallel wires carrying current in the same direction. This
led Ampere to the hypothesis that a magnetic substance contains
permanently circulating electric currents. If so, Oersted's experi-

% p. 173
ment could be understood as the interaction of the ``galvanic'' current
in the wire with the permanent microscopic currents which gave
the compass needle its special properties. Ampere gave a complete
and elegant mathematical formulation of the interaction of steady
currents, and of the equivalence of magnetized matter to systems of
permanent currents. His brilliant conjecture about the actual nature
of magnetism in iron had to wait a century, more or less, for its
ultimate confirmation.

Whether the magnetic manifestations of electric currents arose
from anything more than the simple transport of charge was not clear
to Ampere and his contemporaries. Would the motion of an electro-
statically charged object cause effects like those produced by a continuous
galvanic current? Later in the century Maxwell's theoretical
work suggested the answer should be yes. The first direct evidence
was obtained by Henry Rowland, to whose experiment we shall return
at the end of Chap. 6.

From our present vantage point, the magnetic interaction of
electric currents can be recognized as an inevitable corollary
of Coulomb's law. If the postulates of relativity are valid, if electric
charge is invariant, and if Coulomb's law holds, then the effects we
commonly call ``magnetic'' are bound to occur. They will emerge as
soon as we examine the electric interaction between a moving charge
and other moving charges. A very simple system will illustrate this.

In the ``lab'' frame, as shown in Fig. 5.20:1, we have an infinitely
long procession of positive charges moving to the right with speed 00
and superimposed on it a procession of negative charges moving
toward the left with the same speed. These charges are supposed to
be so numerous and closely spaced that their discreteness can be
ignored at the distances we shall be concerned with. In the figure, for
clarity, we have drawn the two processions slightly separated. For
this system there exists no frame of reference in which all charges
are at rest. Suppose the density of positive charge along the line,
as measured in the laboratory frame, is A, in esu/cm, and the density
of negative charge is the same. 'The net density of charge on the line,
in the ``lab'' frame, is then zero. It follows that the electric field E
is zero in the lab frame. What we have here is equivalent to an uncharged
wire carrying a steady electric current. In a metallic wire
the negative charges only (electrons) would be moving, with the positive
charges at rest. We have taken a more symmetrical model only
to simplify the discussion slightly.

If you were to move at the same speed as the positive charges, you
would find their density along the line different. The situation is like

% p. 174
 

that in the capacitor of Fig. 5.19. In the lab frame the positive charge
distribution would be contracted in the x direction by the factor
(1 --- 1202/ c2)1/ 2, which would make it more dense than in a frame in
which the positive charges were at rest. Since we have specified that
the density in the lab frame shall be A, the density in the rest frame of
the positive charges must be less, namely >\(l - v02/c2)1/2. The
same holds for the linear density of negative charges in their rest
frame. This will be useful presently.

A stationary test charge q some distance r from the ``wire'' experiences
no force because the electric field is zero. We are interested
now in the force on a moving test charge. Suppose the charge q is set
in motion to the right with speed 12, in the lab frame. What force, as
observed in the lab frame, acts on it then? We have learned how such
questions can be answered. We get into a coordinate system moving
with the test charge q. In that ``particle'' frame the charge q is at
rest and the force on it is determined solely by the electric field in
that frame.

Why should there be an electric field in the ``particle'' frame when
there is none in the ``lab'' frame? The reason is that the magnitudes
of the line charge densities seen in the ``particle'' frame, which we
shall denote by M, and >\'_ respectively, are not equal. As observed
in the ``particle'' frame, the wire is charged! It has an excess of negative
charge in every unit of its 1ength.1'

1``'What about charge invariance?'' you may ask. We have always emphasized that
the total charge enclosed within some boundary is the same no matter what frame it is
measured in. In this case no boundary can enclose the total charge on the wire,which
stretches out to infinity; whatever happens at its ``ends'' does not matter here.

% p. 175
To work this out we need to know the speed of the positive charges
and the speed of the negative charges in the new frame of reference.
It is obvious that these are not going to be equal. In fact, since our
``particle'' frame has to move toward the right, as seen in the lab, it
tends to catch up with the positive charges and run away even faster
from the negatives. Figure 5.21 will help to identify the velocities we
have to consider. We are not going to make any approximations, so
we must use the relativistic velocity-addition formula to find the
speeds 0; and v', of the positives and negatives in the ``particle''
frame. These speeds are

J _ D0 - D I _ D0 + D 
M -1 - vov/02 0- _ 1+ vov/02 ( )

Here the ,8 and y symbols will be handy. Let B0 = 130/0, 70 =
(1 - Bo2)""2'; B; = v'+/c, 7; = (1 - B'+2)""2', and so on. In
this notation Eq. 35 is written

Br :80 ' B ,8! _ :80 + :8 

'T173 "1+#oB

The two charge distributions will sufier different amounts of
Lorentz contraction---that is the crux of the matter. We can find the
linear density of the positive charges by starting with the density in
the positives' own rest frame and applying the factor for contraction
to the ``particle'' frame. We worked out earlier the density of positives
in their own rest frame; it was Ml - 1202/c2)1/2, or A/yo in our
new notation. The factor by which the distribution is linearly con-
tracted, as seen from the particle frame is 1/7;, so that the reciprocal
of this, y'+, is the factor by which the linear charge density is increased,
over the density in the rest frame of the positives. Thus the linear
density of positive charge in the particle frame must be:

M. = Y'+ (1) (37)

Yo

Similarly, the density of negative charge in the particle frame is:

>«_ = y:  (38)

We want to find the net density of line charge, A; - >\'_, eliminating
y; and y'_ from these equations by the use of Eq. 36. It looks as

 

% p. 176
though we might be getting into thick algebra, but the substitution
leads promptly to a delightful simplification, as follows:

M ~ >«_ = %(v'+ - w.) (39)

Hence the net line charge density is:

This linear electric charge in the particle frame gives the same electric
field as any line charge of the same density. We need only apply
Gauss's law to a cylinder enclosing the line to obtain the familiar
result that there is a radial electric field of magnitude

Hence the force on the positive test charge q is directed radially in-
ward, that is, in the positive y' direction in the particle frame, and its
magnitude is

This is a transverse force in the particle frame. As measured in the
lab frame, its magnitude will be different. According to our rules
for transforming forces (Eqs. 31), Fy : (1 /-y)F;. This knocks out
the y. We conclude that the magnitude of the force on the charge q,
moving with speed 0 parallel to the ``wire'' in the lab frame, is

% p. 177
Now the quantity 2?\v0, which we could factor out of Eq. 44 if we
wanted to, is just the electric current in our ``wire,'' in esu per second.
That is, A00 is the rate of transport of positive charge to the right---
the amount of positive charge that the procession carries past a given
point per second---and the transport of negative charge to the left
contributes an equal amount to the current. Denoting this current
by I, the magnitude of the force on the moving charge is given by

_ Zqvl

(45)

It is a remarkable fact that the force on the moving test charge
does not depend separately on the velocity or density of the charge
carriers in the wire, but only on the combination that determines the
net charge transport. If we have a certain current, say 107 esu/sec,
which is the same as 3.3 milliamperes, it does not matter whether this
current is composed of high-energy electrons moving with 99 percent
of the speed of light, of electrons in a metal executing random thermal
motion with a slight superimposed drift in one direction, or of
charged ions in solution with positives moving one way, negatives
the other. Also, the force on the test charge is strictly proportional
to the velocity of the test charge. Our derivation was in no way
restricted to small velocities, either for the charge carriers in the wire
or for the test charge. Equation 45, is exact, with no restrictions.

Let's see how this explains the mutual repulsion of conductors
carrying currents in opposite directions, as shown in Fig. 5.1b at the
beginning of this chapter. Assume first that in each conductor there
are equal numbers of positive and negative charge carriers, moving
in opposite directions at the same speed. In the ``lab'' frame we have
something like Fig. 5.22a. Switching to a frame of reference which
moves along with the negative charges in conductor 1 and the positive
charges in conductor 2, we see the system as it appears in
Fig. 5.2212. In this frame conductor 1 has an excess of positive charge
in every unit length; hence it 'repels the positive charges in conductor
2. Similarly, the negatives in conductor 1 are repelled by the
excess negative charge in conductor 2. To find the forces on the remaining
charge carriers---the positives in 1 and the negatives in 2-
we transfer to the frame in which they are at rest, Fig. 5.220. Here
conductor 2 appears with an excess of positive charge, so the positives
in 1 must feel a repulsion. Similarly for the negatives in 2.

Thus every charge carrier, in its own rest frame, experiences a net
renulsion from the charge carriers in the other conductor. To find

% p. 178
 
 
 

the exact strength of the force in the lab frame we would have to
transform the forces back, as we did in the step from Eq. 43 to Eq. 44.
But that can't change the Sign of a force. Hence we are bound to

observe, in the laboratory, a repulsion of each conductor by the
other.

The model ust described could represent conduction in an electrolyte
or an ionized gas, although in general the two types of carriers
might have rather different speeds. In a metal, however, only the
negative charge carriers (electrons) move, while the corresponding
positive charges remain fixed in the crystal lattice. Two such wires
carrying currents in opposite directions are seen in the lab frame in
Fig. 5.23a. The wires being neutral, there is no electric force from
the opposite wire on the positive ions which are stationary in the lab
frame. Transferring to a frame in which one set of electrons is at
rest, Fig. 5.2319, we find that in the other wire the electron distribution
is Lorentz-contracted more than the positive-ion distribution. A
similar situation is found in Fig. 5.230. So this model, too, predicts
a repulsion between parallel currents flowing in opposite directions.
It illustrates, in a qualitative way, the earlier statement that the forces
between currents depend only on the amount of current flow, not on
how the charge is transported. (Problem 5.15 outlines a general
proof of that statement.)

In this chapter we have seen how the fact of charge invariance implies
forces between electric currents. That does not oblige us to
look on one fact as the cause of the other. These are simply two
aspects of electromagnetism whose relationship beautifully illustrates
the more general law: physics is the same in all inertial frames
of reference.

If we had to analyze every system of moving charges by transforming
back and forth among various coordinate systems, our task would
grow both tedious and confusing. There is a better way. The overall
effect of one current on another, or of a current on a moving charge,

can be described completely and concisely by introducing a new field,
the magnetic field.

Problems

5.1 A capacitor consists of two parallel rectangular plates with a vertical
separation of 2 cm. The east-west dimension of the plates is 20 cm, the north-
south dimension is l0 cm. The capacitor has been charged by connecting it
temporarily to a battery of 300 volts (1 statvolt). How many excess electrons
are on the negative plate? What is the electric field strength between the
plates? Now give the following quantities as they would be measured in a
frame of reference which is moving eastward, relative to the laboratory in which
the plates are at rest, with speed 0.60: the three dimensions of the capacitor; the
number of excess electrons on the negative plate; the electric field strength
between the plates. Answer the same questions for a frame of reference which
is moving upward with speed 0.6a.

5.2 As a rough measure of the relativistic ``flattening'' of the configuration
of electric field lines from a moving charge, we might use the angle oz between
two conical surfaces which include between them half the total electric flux.
That is, half the flux through a sphere shall be contained in the equatorial zone
between 0' = 7r/2 + 01/2 and 0' = 77/2 - oi/2. Consider only the extreme
relativistic case, with y > 1. Then only angles 0' such that 0' = 77/2 - c, with
is: < 1 need be considered. Show first that Eq. 12 can be approximated, in
this case, as

5.3 A 30-Bev proton passes l0'7 cm away from a hydrogen atom. Estimate
the peak magnitude of the electric field and the approximate duration of the
electric field pulse to which the atom is subjected. Do the same for a 30-Bev
electron passing at the same distance. Use the approximate equivalents for
the rest masses, namely 1 Bev for the proton, 0.5 Mev for the electron.

5.4 Consider the trajectory of a charged particle which is moving with a
speed 0.80 in the x direction when it enters a large region in which there is a
miform electric field in the y direction. Show that the x velocity of the particle
nust actually decrease. What about the 2: component of momentum?

5.5 The deflection plates in a high-voltage cathode-ray oscilloscope are

s a difference of potential of 6000 volts between the plates. An electron which
as been accelerated through a potential difference of 250 kilovolts enters this

lefiector from the left, moving parallel to the plates and halfway between them,
iitially. We want to find the position of the electron and its direction of
'lOtl01'1 when it leaves the deflecting field at the other end of the plates. We
1all neglect the fringing field and assume the electric field between the plates
l uniform right up to the end. The rest mass of the electron may be taken as
90 keV. First carry out the analysis in the ``lab'' frame by answering these

flight at exit? Now describe this whole process as it would appear in an inertial
frame which moved with the electron at the moment it entered the de-
ffecting region: What do the plates look like? What is the field between them?
What happens to the electron in this coordinate system? Your main object
in this exercise is to convince yourself that the two descriptions are completely
consistent.

Would the fields in the transition region tend to reinforce or cancel? Can you

5.7 A charge moves in along the positive x axis, moving toward the origin
with speed 0. It reaches the origin at t = 0, and is instantly stopped and
reversed (as if it had rebounded elastically) so that it then moves out with the
same constant speed in the positive x direction. Sketch the field at some time
after the particle was reflected.

5.8 The figure shows a highly relativistic positive particle approaching
the origin from the left and a negative particle approaching with equal speed
from the right. They collide at the origin at t = 0, find some way to dispose
of their kinetic energy, and remain there as a neutral entity. What do you
think the electric field looks like at some time t > 0? Sketch the field lines.

5.9 Particle 1, with charge ql, was at rest. Particle 2, with charge qg, went
past it, moving at speed 1), the closest distance of approach being 19. The first
particle was so massive that the velocity it acquired from the Coulomb force
caused only negligible displacement during the time of passage. Likewise,
the second particle was so massive that any change in speed or deflection of
its path from a straight line was negligible. How much transverse momentum
was acquired by each particle, as a result of the near encounter? (Transverse
here means perpendicular to the direction of motion of particle 2.) Answer
this first for particle 2, working in the frame where particle l is at rest. Gauss's
law applied to a cylinder will make an integration unnecessary. Is your
formula relativistically exact'? Now consider the momentum acquired by
particle 1. The field acting on it is that of a moving charge, given by Eq. 12.
By the appropriate integration the transverse momentum could be calculated.
However, you could also justify the use of Gauss's law instead, or you could
argue directly from your first result. Explain.

Ans. (to both parts): 2q1q2/vb.

5.10 In Sec. 5.9 the distinction between invariance of charge and conservation
of charge was emphasized, and it was remarked that conservation does
not necessarily imply invariance. However, the statement that Gauss's law
holds in one frame of reference for any surface, together with relativity, does
imply charge conservation. Show this by discussing the following hypothetical
situation: A positive charge is suddenly created at the origin, at t = 0. At some
time t : t1, observers determine the surface integral of E, over surfaces of
various radii. Take it from there.

Chapter 6 The Magnetic Field

6.1 Definition of the Magnetic Field

A charge which is moving parallel to a current of other charges
experiences a force perpendicular to its own velocity. This emerged
from our analysis of the situation shown in Fig. 5.20 of the last
chapter. We can see it happening in the deflection of an electron
beam by a nearby current, as in Fig. 5.3. We have yet to show what
happens if we send our test charge moving in some other direction.
You can recognize already, however, the behavior that is usually
described by saying that there is a magnetic field around a wire that
carries current and a moving charge experiences a force in a magnetic
field. Just as we have defined the electric field vector E as the force
on unit test charge at rest, so we can now define another field by the
velocity-proportional part of the force that acts on a test charge in
motion. To state this precisely, suppose that, at some position and
time in a particular frame of reference, experiments show that the
force on a test charge q moving with uniform velocity v is given by

F=qE+%vxB (1)

where E and B are vectors that do not depend on v. If that holds,
we define E as the electric field at that place and we define B as the
magnetic field at that place.

To justify the definition fully we would have to show, by experiment
or otherwise, that such a relation always can be found. We
have not completed that task, but we have shown that it holds in some
important and instructive special cases. In Sec. 5.8 we proved that
the force on the test charge is strictly independent of its velocity if
all other charges are stationary. In that case, Eq. 1 holds with B : 0
everywhere. The argument we have just been through shows that
the particle moving parallel to the steady stream of charge carriers
in the ``wire'' experiences a force that is proportional to its velocity
and perpendicular thereto, as required by the cross-product relation
in Eq. 1. In fact we can say exactly what magnetic field vector B
would be consistent with our findings and with the symmetry of the
system. It would be a vector perpendicular to the plane of the dia-
gram, that is, perpendicular to both the wire and the test-charge

10/l

% p. 185
velocity v. To make Eq. 5.45 and Eq. 1 consistent, the magnitude
of B must be:

21
B = To (2)

We have derived the magnetic field of a straight current by analyzing
only the electric field of moving charges. Our derivation is in-
complete, but in ways that are not essential. We ought to show that
a velocity-dependent force, of the same magnitude and proper direc-
tion, arises also if we make the test charge move radially toward or
away from the ``wire.'' That can be done in the same way, although
the mathematical details are a little more tedious if we try to carry
it through without any approximation. What is interesting is not the
mathematics of the coordinate transformations but the reason for
the existence of the force. We can discover that without doing any
calculations.

In Fig. 6.1a we have sketched the ''lab'' frame with the test particle
moving toward the wire. In the ``particle'' frame (Fig. 6.1b) where
the test charge is at rest, we see the line of positive and negative
charges advancing down toward the test charge, while the individual
charges move obliquely, the positives obliquely down to the right,
the negatives obliquely down to the left. It is rather like some

o'3so'o*ooo¢eoeoooo....__;L_......'..

% p. 186
marching maneuver of a college band. What we hope to find in this
frame is an electric field E' pointing to the left.T Still, everything
appears quite symmetrical; how can such a field arise?

Consider one of the positive charges P1 in the particle frame, and

a symmetrically located positive charge P2. (If we were to sum the
contributions of all the positive charges, we could always group them
in such symmetrical pairs, one from the right half of the line, one
from the left.) The electric fields of these two charges are indicated
in Fig. 6.2a. It is now clear why they do not produce equal effects
at q. The relativistic contraction of the field, described by the factor
[1 --- ,8? sin? 0']'3/2 in Eq. 5.12, makes the field of P2 stronger at q
than the field of P1. If the fields were spherically symmetrical they
would cancel, so far as an x' component is concerned. Instead, P2
wins, resulting in an x' component to the left.

Now take two symmetrically located negative charges, N1 and N2,
as shown in Fig. 6.21). In this case N1 produces the stronger field and
that also results in a component of electric field in the negative x'
direction. On the other hand, the y' components of the fields of the
positive and negative charges obviously cancel one another. We are
left with an electric field E' and consequently a force on q, which is
parallel to the wire, in the negative x' direction.

We can now see plainly that the magnetic interaction between
moving charges is a relativistic effect. That was already indicated
by the appearance of the factor D00/C2 in Eq. 5.44. In a world of
moving electric charges, magnetism would vanish if 0 were infinite.
That being so, it seems odd that magnetic forces can be strong enough
to turn motor armatures and lift weights. We remarked earlier that
electrostatic forces between large-scale objects are not, as a rule, very
impressive. Why aren't magnetic forces very much weaker still?
The explanation is the almost exact electrical neutrality of bulk
matter. Our next example will provide a good illustration of this.
We shall calculate the force to be expected, in a practical case, between
two parallel wires carrying current.

Because this example involves us, for the first time, with a magnetic
field inside matter, we must interrupt the discussion to remark on
that point. Most metals, including copper (but not including iron),
and most substances generally, have almost no influence on a magnetic
field. We may assume that the field B inside copper is prac-

TWe are looking for a force which will appear to an observer in the lab frame as a

force perpendicular to the velocity of the test particle, just as the force in the first case

was perpendicular to the velocity, and to the left of the velocity vector as seen from
above.

tically the same as it would be in vacuum with the same currents
flowing. We shall go into these questions thoroughly in Chap. 10.
Until then we'll avoid iron.

Consider two copper wires 1 mm in diameter, 5 cm apart (Fig. 6.3).
A current is flowing in each wire; let us assume the average velocity
of the conduction electrons in each wire to be 0.5 cm/sec. As we
know, this average drift velocity is much smaller than the random
velocities of the electrons. If we assume there is one conduction
electron per copper atom, we can easily find the number of conduction
electrons in a 1-cm length of 1-mm diameter wire. It is about
6 X 1020. (For this estimate we need the density of copper,
8 gm/cm3; the atomic weight of copper, 64; and Avogadro's
number.) The linear density A of the negative charge that moves is
then

A = (6 X 1020) X (4.8 X l0'1°) : 3 X 1011 esu/cm (3)

The positive charges are stationary. The product of A times the drift
velocity is (3 X l011)(O.5) = 1.5 X 1011 esu/sec, which is about
50 amperes of current.

Let us now find the force on an electron in the other wire, at
distance r = 5 cm. This electron also moves with the average speed
0.5 cm/sec, if the same current is flowing in that wire. Applying
Eq. 5.45, we have:

_ 2q>\vv0 _ 2(4.8 X 10'10 esu)(3 X 1011 esu/cm) (0.5 cm/sec)?

m2 (5 cm) (3 X 1010 cm/sec)?
2 1.6 X 10'2° dyne (4)

F

Since every conduction electron in the other wire experiences such
a force, the total force on the electrons in 1 cm of wire is (6 X 1020) X
(1.6 X l0'2°), or approximately 10 dynes/cm. We observe this as
a force on the wire itself; any momentum imparted to the electrons
is eventually transferred to the lattice that confines them. As for the
direction of the force, our analysis of the situation in Fig. 5.20 shows
that when charges of the same sign move parallel to one another, the
magnetic interaction tends to draw them together. Hence our copper
wires, if they carry current in the same direction, will be drawn toward
one another with a force amounting to 10 dynes per centimeter of
wire. This will be true of any two parallel straight wires the same distance
apart carrying the equivalent current, 50 amperes.

Now 10 dynes is not an enormous force, but it is easily measurable.
Let us compare it with the electrostatic force that would act between

 

% p. 188
 

the wires if they carried uncompensated static charge of 3 X 1011
esu/ cm on each wire. The electric field of a line charge of density
A being 2A/r (Eq. 1.26), the force that acts per centimeter of length
on a similar line charge r cm away must be 2A2/r. Substituting the
linear charge density we assumed for the electrons in the wire,
3 X 1011 esu/cm, we obtain a force just (-c/0)? times larger than the
magnetic interaction of 10 dynes/cm, namely 36 x 1021 dynes/cm,
or roughly 4 x 1013 tons /cm! Magnetic phenomena would be relatively
inconspicuous, to put it mildly, if Nature did not provide two
kinds of charge capable of canceling off`` the electrostatic interaction
---but of course a world with only one kind of charge would be unimaginably
different anyway. In the atomic domain, where the full
Coulomb force between elementary particles comes into play, magnetic
effects do indeed take second place compared to electric inter-
actions. They are weaker, generally speaking, by just the factor we
should expect, the square of the ratio of the particle speed to the
speed of light.

The magnetic interaction between parallel currents depends only
on the products of the currents, not on the charge densities and
velocities separately. We introduced charge density and velocity into
the example above in order to make the comparison of the electrostatic
and the magnetic interactions. Ordinarily we are concerned
only with the total current in each wire, and the mechanism of charge
transport, whether by many charges moving slowly or few charges
moving rapidly, doesn't matter at all. Let conductor 1 in Fig. 6.4
carry a current 11 esu/sec. Suppose that in conductor 2, at distance r,
there is an amount of charge A esu/cm which is moving with
velocity 02. We know that the force per unit length of conductor
2 must be 2 I1}\o2/1'02, but that is equivalent to:

21112
rc2

Force per centimeter = (5)
because M2 is the current 12 in the second conductor.

Expressed in terms of a magnetic field B the magnitude of the force
on a conductor which carries a steady current I, in a magnetic field B
due to other currents, is IB/c per centimeter of conductor. The force
is perpendicular to the conductor and to the magnetic field, so we
can write this statement in vector form as follows:

dF=%dlxB (6)

% p. 189
In Eq. 6, dF is the force on a short section of a conductor of length dl,
carrying a steady current I measured in esu/sec. The vector dl points
in the direction of positive current flow. Equation 6 follows directly
from our definition of B in Eq. 1, and from the definition of current
in terms of charge transport. It holds for a conducting path of any
shape; we need only know the magnetic field vector B at every point
on the path. Note that you can get Eq. 6 by remembering that the
force on a charge element dq which is moving with speed v is

dF = dq(v/c) x B. Then with v = dl/dt and dq = Idt, this turns
at once into

I dt dl I dl
dF : - - B = : B 7
c dt X c X ( )
So far we have chosen to measure I in esu/sec. The practical unit
of current, the ampere, is 3 X 109 esu/sec.)' If the current in a
straight wire is expressed in amperes, the magnetic field at a distance
r cm from the wire is

2 I (amp)

B (gauss) = W 7 (cm)

(3)
The factor 2/10 is exact, the 1/10 coming from the ratio of 3 X 109

to c. Similarly, the force on a conductor carrying I amperes in a field
of B gauss is

dF (dynes) = -1161 (amp) dl x B (cm - gauss) (9)

The unit for B implied by these formulas, with force in dynes and
distance in centimeters, is called the gauss. It has long been used by
physicists and engineers, and in spite of competition from other systems
of units, is likely to remain the most familiar unit of magnetic
field strength. The intensity of the earth's magnetic field, near the
surface of the earth, is of the order of one-half gauss. The field at
one of the wires, in Fig. 6.3, arising from the current in the other wire,
is about 2 gauss. The field between the poles of a large electromagnet
is likely to be measured in thousands of gauss (kilogauss). It is quite
easy to reach 10 to 20 kilogauss in an iron magnet, and 60 to 80 kilo-
gauss in a commercially available superconducting magnet. Fields
above 105 gauss require rather special efibrt. On the sun's surface,
local regions (sunspots) display magnetic fields of hundreds of gauss,

TWe remarked in Chap. 1 that such ``3's'' come from the speed of light. Now we
see how that happens. The exact number is of course 2.9979 \ldots

% p. 190
 

and a few stars are known which have general surface fields greater
than one kilogauss. On the whole, the large-scale magnetic fields in
the universe are rather weak in absolute magnitude, by comparison.
A recent measurement (a special kind of spectroscopic measure-
ment) of the interstellar magnetic field in one small region in our
Galaxy gave around 10'5 gauss. On the scale of the Galaxy a field
of that magnitude is not insignificant. In fact the magnetic field plays
an essential, sometimes dominant, role in galactic dynamics. Thus a
unit of one gauss, about the magnitude of the only magnetic field
man had explored for centuries, is now roughly the geometric mean
between the important magnetic fields of cosmology, and the strongest
fields in the laboratory.

We should add that the quantity we have defined as B and have
been calling the magnetic field strength, is called in some books the
magnetic induction.

6.2 Some Properties of the Magnetic Field

The magnetic field, like the electric field, is a device for describing
how charged particles interact with one another. If we say that the
magnetic field at the point (4.5,3.2,6.0) at 12:00 noon points horizontally
in the negative y direction and has a magnitude of 5 gauss.
we are making a statement about the acceleration which a moving
charged particle at that point in space-time would exhibit. The remarkable
thing is that a statement of this form, giving simply a vector
quantity B, says all there is to say. With it one can predict uniquely
the velocity-dependent part of the force on any charged particle moving
with any velocity. It makes unnecessary any further description
of the other charged particles which are the sources of the field. In
other words, if two quite different systems of moving charges happen
to produce the same E and B at a particular point, the behavior of
any test particle at the point would be exactly the same in the two
systems. It is for this reason only that the concept of field. as an intermediary
in the interaction of particles, is useful. And it is for this
reason that we think of the field as an independent entity.

Is the field more, or less, real than the particles whose interaction,
as seen from our present point of view, it was invented to describe?
That is a deep question which we would do well to set aside for a long
time. People to whom the electric and magnetic fields were vividly
real---Faraday and Maxwell, to name two---were led thereby to new
insights and great discoveries. Let's view the magnetic field as concretely
as they did and learn some of its properties.

% p. 191
So far we have studied only the magnetic field of a straight wire
or filament of steady current. The field direction, we found, is everywhere
perpendicular to a plane containing the filament and the point
where the field is observed. The magnitude of the field is proportional
to 1 /r. The field lines are circles surrounding the filament, as
sketched in Fig. 6.5. The sense of direction of B is determined by our
previously adopted convention about the vector cross-product, by
the (arbitrary) decision to write the second term in Eq. 1 as
+ (q/c) v x B, and by the physical fact that a positive charge moving
in the direction of a positive current is attracted to it rather than
repelled. These are all consistent if we relate the direction of B to
the direction of the current that is its source in the manner shown
in Fig. 6.5. Looking in the direction of positive current, B lines curl
clockwise. Or you may prefer to remember it as a right-hand-thread
relation.

Let's look at the line integral of B around a closed path in this field.
(Remember that a similar inquiry in the case of the electric field of
a point charge led us to a simple and fundamental property of all
electrostatic fields.) Consider first the path ABCD in Fig. 6.6a. This
lies in a plane perpendicular to the wire; in fact, we need only work
in this plane. for B has no component parallel to the wire. The line
integral of B around the path shown is zero, for the following reason.
Paths BC and DA are perpendicular to B and contribute nothing.
Along AB, B is stronger in the ratio r2/r1 than it is along CD; but CD
is longer than AB by the same factor, for these two arcs subtend the
same angle at the wire. So the two arcs give equal and opposite con-
tributions, and the whole integral is zero.

It follows that the line integral is also zero on any path that can
be constructed out of radial segments and arcs, such as the path in
Fig. 6.61). From this it is a short step to conclude that the line integral
is zero around any path that does not enclose the wire. To smooth
out the corners we would only need to show that the integral around
a little triangular path vanishes to a sufficient order. The same step
was involved in the case of the electric field.

A path which does not enclose the wire is one like the path in
Fig. 6.6c, which, if it were made of string, could be pulled free. The
line integral around any such path is zero.

Now consider a circular path that encloses the wire, as in Fig. 6.6d.
Here the circumference is 2-rrr, the field is 21 /or and everywhere parallel
to the path, so the value of the line integral around this particular
path is (27rr) (21/rc), or 47rI/c. We now claim that any path looping
once around the wire must give the same value. Consider, for in-

The magnetic field, as we have emphasized before, depends only
on the rate of charge transport, the number of units of charge passing
a given point in the circuit, per second. Figure 6.7 shows a circuit
with a current of 5 mA (milliamperes), equivalent to 15 )< 106
esu/sec. The average velocity of the charge carriers ranges from
10-4 cm/sec in one part of the circuit to 0.8 times the speed of light
in another. The line integral of B over a closed path has the same
value around every part of this circuit, namely:

fB_ds _ ffI__ 477 )< (15 x 106 esu/sec)
_ c _ 3 x 1010 cm/sec
= 0.00628 gauss-cm (11)

What we have proved for the case of a long straight filament of
current clearly holds, by superposition, for the field of any system
of straight filaments. In Fig. 6.8 several wires are carrying currents
in different directions. If Eq. 10 holds for the magnetic field of one
of these wires, it must hold for the total field which is the vector sum,
at every point, of the fields of the individual wires. That is a pretty
complicated field. Nevertheless, we can predict the value of the line
integral of B around the closed path in Fig. 6.8 merely by noting
which currents the path encircles, and in which sense.

However, we are interested in other things than long straight wires.
We want to understand the magnetic field of any sort of current dis-
tribution---for example, that of a current flowing in a closed loop. It
turns out that these more general fields obey exactly the same law,
Eq. 10. The line integral of B around a bent wire is equal to that
around a long straight wire carrying the same current. This goes
beyond anything we have so far deduced, so we must look on it here
as a postulate confirmed by the experimental tests of its con-
sequences.

To state the law in the most general way, we must talk about volume
distributions of current._ A general steady current distribution
is described by a volume current density J (x,y,z) which varies from
place to place but is constant in time. A current in a wire is merely
a special case in which J has a large value within the wire but is zero
elsewhere. We discussed volume distribution of current in Chap. 4,
where we noted that for time-independent currents, J has to satisfy
the continuity equation, or conservation-of-charge condition,

divJ = 0 (12)

% p. 194
 

Take any closed curve C in a region where currents are flowing.
The total current enclosed by C is the flux of J through the surface

spanning C, that is, the surface integral ISJ - da over this surface S

(see Fig. 6.9). A general statement of the relation in Eq. 10 is
therefore:

fen-ds=4T"'SJ-da (13)

Let us compare this with Stokes' theorem, which we developed in
Chap. 2:

fCF - ds : fS(curl F) - da (14)
We see that a statement equivalent to Eq. 13 is this:

M
C

curlB_-_ (15)

This is the simplest and most general statement of the relation between
the magnetic field and the moving charges which are its source.
However, Eq. 15 is not enough to determine B(x,y,z), given
J(x,y,z), for many different vector fields could have the same curl.
We need to complete it with another condition. We had better think
about the divergence of B. Going back to the magnetic field of a
single straight wire, we observe that the divergence of that field is
zero. You can't draw a little box anywhere, even one enclosing the
wire, which will have a net outward or inward flux. It is enough to
note that the boxes V1 and V2 in Fig. 6.10 have no net flux and can
shrink to zero without developing any. For this field then, div B = 0,
and hence also for all superpositions of such fields. Again we postulate
that the principle can be extended to the field of any distribution
of currents, so that a companion to Eq. 12 is the condition

<16>

Equations 15 and 16 together very nearly determine B uniquely
if J is given. If we had two different fields B1(x,y,z) and B2(x,y,:)
both satisfying Eqs. 15 and 16, their difference B1 --- B2 would be a
field with zero divergence and zero curl everywhere. Such a field is
simply a constant vector B0, the same at all points in space. So except
for the possible addition of a constant field pervading all space, the
conditions curl B = 47rJ/c, and div B = 0, uniquely determine the

% p. 195
magnetic field of a given distribution of currents. It is interesting
to compare these with their counterparts in the case of the electrostatic
field. There we had the conditions

div E = 477p and curl E = 0 (17)

In the case of the electric field, however, we began with Coulomb's
law, which expressed directly the contribution of each charge to the
electric field at any point. Here we shall have to work our way back
to some relation of that type.T We shall do so by means of a potential
function.

6.3 Vector Potential

We found that the scalar potential function $\pot$(x,y,z) gave us a
simple way to calculate the electrostatic field of a charge distribution.
If there is some charge distribution p(x,y,z), the potential at any
point (x1,y1,z1) is given by the volume integral

f  (18)

'P(x1,!/1.31) = H2

The integration is extended over the whole charge distribution, and
r12 is the magnitude of the distance from (x2,y2,z2) to (x1,y1,z1). The
electric field E is obtained as the negative of the gradient of (p:

E = -grad$\pot$ (19)

The same trick won't work here, because of the essentially different
character of B. The curl of B is not necessarily zero, so B can't, in
general, be the gradient of a scalar potential. However, we know
another kind of vector derivative, the curl. It turns out that we can
usefully represent B, not as the gradient of a scalar function, but as
the curl of a vector function, like this:

00>

By obvious analogy, we call A the vector potential. It is not
obvious, at this point, why this tactic is helpful. That will have to

TThe student may wonder why we couldn't have started from some equivalent of
Coulomb's law for the interaction of currents. The answer is that a piece of a current
filament, unlike an electric charge, is not an independent object that can be physically
isolated. You cannot perform an experiment to determine the field from part of a
circuit: if the rest of the circuit isn't there. the current can't be steady without violating
the continuity condition.

 

% p. 196
emerge as we proceed. It is encouraging that Eq. 16 is automatically
satisfied, since div curl A = 0, for any A.T Or to put it another way,
the fact that div B = 0 presents us with the opportunity to represent
B as the curl of another vector function. Our job now is to discover
how to calculate A, when the current distribution J is given, so that
Eq. 20 will indeed yield the correct magnetic field. In view of Eq. 15,
the relation between J and A is

curl (curl A) = 4L' (21)

0

Equation 21, being a vector equation, is really three equations.
We shall work out one of them, say the x-component equation. The
x component of curl B is BB,/ By - BB,/Bz. The z and y components
of B are, respectively,

BA BA BA BA
B, = 1' - " B = 3 - 2 22
Bx By 1' Bz Bx ( )
Thus the x component part of Eq. 21 reads
_B_(BA,, _ BA,) _  _ BA,) : 477], (23)
By Bx By Bz Bz Bx c

We assume our functions are such that the order of partial differentiation
can be interchanged. Taking advantage of that and rearranging
a little, we can write Eq. 23 in this way:

_ a2A,_ BZA, a (aA,)+ a (aA,)_ 4771, (24)

By? Bzz + B-x By B-x Bz c
To make the thing more symmetrical, 1et's add and subtract the same
term, BZA,/Bx2, on the left:

ax? By? Bz2 +59?

2 2 2
B A, B A, B A, B (BA, + BA, + BA,) : 47rJ, (25)
Bx By Bz c

We can now recognize the first three terms as the negative of the
Laplacian of A,. The quantity in parentheses is the divergence of A.
Now we have a certain latitude in the construction of A. All we care

about is its curl; its divergence can be anything we like. Let us
require thatl'

div A = 0 (26)

In other words, among the various functions which might satisfy our
requirement that curl A = B, let us consider as candidates only those
which also have zero divergence. Then that part of Eq. 25 drops
away and we are left simply with

a2A, a2A, a2A, _ 4771,

(27)

J, is a known scalar function of x, y, z. Let us compare Eq. 27 with
Poisson's equation, Eq. 2.70, which read:

-+---,+-=-4m> <28)

The two equations are identical in form. We already know how to
find a solution to Eq. 28. The volume integral in Eq. 18 is the pre-
scription. Therefore a solution to Eq. 27 must be given by

l J, , d
A.(x1,y1.z1> = 3f (29)

The other components must satisfy similar formulas. They can all
be combined neatly in one vector formula:

A<x1,y1.z1) = %f (30)

There is only one snag. We stipulated that div A = 0, in order to
get Eq. 27. How do we know the A given by Eq. 30 will have this
special property? Fortunately, it can be shown that it does.

As an example of a vector potential, consider a long straight wire
carrying a current I. In Fig. 6.11 we see the current coming toward
us out of the page, flowing along the positive z axis. We know what
the magnetic field of the straight wire looks like. The field lines are
circles, as sketched already in Fig. 6.5. A few are shown in Fig. 6.11.

TTO see why we are free to do this, suppose we had an A such that curl A _-. B, but
div A = f(x,y,z) aé 0. Treating f like the charge density p in an electrostatic field, we
obviously can find a field F, the analog of the electrostatic E, such that div F = f.
But we know that the curl of such a field will be zero. Hence we could add -F to A,
making a new field with the correct curl and zero divergence.

% p. 198
The magnitude of B is 21 /or. Using a unit vector (in in the ``circum-
ferential'' direction we can write the vector B as

_ 21¢
- or

B

(31)

Noting that the unit vector (in is - sin (pf: +' cos tpy, we can write this
in terms of x and y as follows:

B=2I(-sin<px+cos<py) :2_I(-yx+xy) (32)

0, /x2 + y2 C x2 + yz

One vector function A(x,y,z) that will satisfy V x A : B is the
following:

A = 4% In (x2 + y2) (33)

To verify this, we calculate the components of V x A:

aA,, _ 6A,, _ -219

(V X A), : _ e :B,
ay 8;' c(x2 + y?) ( )
aA, aAz 21
(v x A). = 53 - ax =  <=B.,> (34)
(V x A)z 2 5;! _ 3;' = 0 (:32)

Of course, this is not the only function that could serve as the vector
potential for this particular B. To the A of Eq. 33 could be added any
vector function with zero curl. This all holds for the space outside
the wire. Inside the wire, B is different, so A must be different also.
It is not hard to find the appropriate vector potential function for
the interior of a solid round wire---see Prob. 6.13.

Incidentally, the A for our particular example above could not
have been obtained by Eq. 30. The integral would diverge owing to
the infinite extent of the wire. This may remind you of the difficulty
we encountered in Chap. 2 in setting up a scalar potential for the
electric field of a charged wire. Indeed the two problems are very
closely related, as we should expect from their identical geometry
and the similarity of Eqs. 30 and 18. We found (Eq. 2.19) that a suitable
scalar potential for the line charge problem is -}x In (x2 + y?) +
arbitrary constant. This assigns zero potential to some arbitrary
point which is neither on the wire nor at infinite distance away. Both
that scalar potential and the vector potential of Eq. 33 are singular
at the origin and at infinity.

% p. 199
6.4 Field of Any Current-carrying Wire

Figure 6.12 shows a loop of wire carrying current I. The vector
potential A at the point (x1,y1,z1) is given according to Eq. 30 by the
integral over the loop. For current confined to a thin wire we may
take as the volume element dug a short section of the wire of length dl.
The current density J is I/a, where a is the cross-section area, and
dD2 = adl. Hence J dog = I dl, and if we make the vector dl point
in the direction of positive current, we can simply replace J (102 by

I dl. Thus for a thin wire or filament, we can write Eq. 30 as a line
integral over the circuit:

A=Lff
C 712

(35)

To calculate A everywhere and then find B by taking the curl of A
might be a long job. It will be more useful to isolate one contribution
to the line integral for A, the contribution from the segment of
wire at the origin, where the current happens to be flowing in the
x direction (Fig. 6.13). We shall denote the length of this segment
by dl. Let dA be the contribution of this part of the integral to A.

Then at the point (x,y,0) in the xy plane, dA, which points in the
positive or direction, is

(I/c)dl
' /x2 + y2

dA = ,2 (36)

% p. 200
It is clear from symmetry that the contribution of this part of A to
curl A must be perpendicular to the xy plane. Denoting the corresponding
part of B by dB we have

(x2 + y2)3/2
(I/c)dl sin (1:

dB = curl (dA) = 2 (_ 3A")

(37)

With this result we can free ourselves at once from a particular
coordinate system. Obviously all that matters is the relative orientation
of the element dl and the radius vector r from that element to
the point where the field B is to be found. The contribution to B
from any short segment of wire dl can be taken to be a vector
perpendicular to the plane containing dl and r, of magnitude
I dl sin (p/1'20, where $\pot$ is the angle between dl and r. This can be

written compactly using the cross-product, and is illustrated in
Fig. 6.14.

_Idlxf-
_ GT2

dB

(38)

% p. 201
If you are familiar with the rules of the vector calculus, you can take
a short cut from Eq. 35 to Eq. 38. Writing dB = V x dA, with
dA = I dl/cr, we treat V as a vector, reversing the order of the cross-
product and changing the sign. Here dl is a constant, so that V
operates only on 1/r, otherwise we couldn't get away with this! We

recall that V( l /r) = -f/r2 (as in going from the Coulomb potential
to the Coulomb field). Thus:

dB=VxLu= _Ld1xv<l)
Cr C T
=_ldtx(-L2)=j'd':" (39)
C 7' CT

Historically, Eq. 38 is known as the Biot-Savart Law. The meaning
of Eq. 38 is that if B is computed by integrating over the complete
circuit, taking the contribution from each element to be given by this
formula, the resulting B will be correct. As we remarked in the footnote
at the end of Sec. 6.2, the contribution of part of a circuit is not
physically identifiable. In fact, Eq. 38 is not the only formula that
could be used to get a correct result for B-to it could be added any
function which would give zero when integrated around a closed
path.

We seem to have discarded the vector potential as soon as it performed
one essential service for us. Indeed, it is often easier, as a
practical matter, to calculate the field of a current system directly,
now that we have Eq. 38, than to find the vector potential first. We
shall practice on some examples in the next section. However, the
vector potential is important for deeper reasons. For one thing, it
has revealed to us a striking parallel between the relation of the electrostatic
field E to its sources, electric charges. and the relation of the
magnetic field B to steady currents. Its greatest usefulness lies ahead,
in the study of time-varying fields, and electromagnetic radiation.

6.5 Fields of Rings and Coils

A current filament in the form of a circular ring of radius bis shown
in Fig. 6.l5a. We could predict without any calculation that the
magnetic field of this source must look something like Fig. 6.151»,
where we have sketched some field lines in a plane through the axis
of symmetry. The field as a whole must be rotationally symmetrical
about this axis, the z axis in Fig. 6.l5a, and the field lines themselves
must be symmetrical with respect to the plane of the loop, the

% p. 202
xy plane. Very close to the filament the field will resemble that near
a long straight wire, since the distant parts of the ring are there relatively
unimportant.

It is easy to calculate the field on the axis, using Eq. 38. Each element
of the ring of length dl contributes a dB perpendicular to r. We

need only include the 2: component of dB, for we know the total field
on the axis must point in the z direction,

Idl Idlb
dB: = goes 0 = $7 (40)

Integrating over the whole ring, we have simply f dl = 2771), so the
field on the axis at any point z, is

Bz = 27rb2I _ 2771721

073 -    on axis) 

At the center of the ring, 2: = 0, the magnitude of the field is

_ 2771

B, _ W (field at center) (42)

The cylindrical coil of wire shown in Fig. 6.l6a is usually called a
solenoid. We assume the wire is closely and evenly spaced so that

% p. 203
the number of turns in the winding, per centimeter length along the
cylinder, is a constant, n. Now the current path is actually helical,
but if the turns are many and closely spaced we can ignore this and
regard the whole solenoid as equivalent to a stack of current rings.
Then we can use Eq. 41 as a basis for calculating the field at any point
such as the point z, on the axis of the coil. Take first the contribution
from the current ring included between radii from the point z making
angles 0 and 0 + d0 with the axis. The length of this segment of the
solenoid, shaded in Fig. 6.16b, is 7 d0/ sin 0, and it is therefore equivalent
to a ring carrying a current Inr d0/ sin 0. Since r = b/ sin 0, we
have, for the contribution of this ring to the axial field:

C13 sin0 c

Carrying out the integration between the limits 01 and 02 gives

3, = 27"" fifsin (M0 = 2:1" (cos 0. _ cos 0,) (44)

C 1

We have used Eq. 44 to make a graph, in Fig. 6.17, of the field
strength on the axis of a coil the length of which is four times its
diameter. The ordinate is the field strength B, relative to the field

% p. 204
 

strength in a coil of infinite length with the same number of turns
per centimeter and the same current in each turn. For the infinite
coil, 01 = 0 and 02 = 7r, so

B, = 4:1" (infinitely long solenoid) (45)
At the center of the ``four-to-one" coil the field is very nearly as large

as this, and it stays pretty nearly constant until we approach one of
the ends.

Figure 6.18 shows the magnetic field lines in and around a coil of
these proportions. Note that some field lines actually penetrate the

% p. 205
winding. The cylindrical sheath of current is a surface of discontinuity
for the magnetic field. Of course, if we were to examine the
field Very closely in the neighborhood of the wires, we would not find
any infinitely abrupt kinks, but we would find a very complicated,
ripply pattern around and through the individual wires.

It is quite possible to make a long solenoid with a single turn of a
thin wide ribbonlike conductor, as in Fig. 6.19. To this our calculation
and the diagram in Fig. 6.18 apply exactly, the quantity nI being
merely replaced by the current per centimeter flowing in the sheet.
Now the change in direction of a field line that penetrates the wall
occurs entirely within the thickness of the sheet, as suggested in the
inset in Fig. 6.19.

We could have found the field of the infinitely long solenoid without
going through the analysis leading to Eq. 45. In the infinite

solenoid, clearly, nothing can vary with z, the coordinate in the axial
direction. The field must be parallel to 2 everywhere. Consider the
line integral of B around a rectangular path like the path ABCDA in
Fig. 6.20. The horizontal sides give nothing. The side CD had better
give zero also, for if the line integral on CD has a finite value, the
integral along any other such leg, such as C'D' would have to give
the same, and we would have magnetic 'field filling all space outside
the coil with constant intensity. We conclude that the field outside
must be zero.T That leaves the line integral of B along AB which is
B21 and the entire line integral must equal 477/c times the enclosed
current. Hence Bzl = (471/c)nIl, or B2 = 4-rrnl/c, in agreement
with Eq. 45.

TWhy couldn't such a solenoid produce a uniform field in the entire space outside?
After all, the infinite flat current sheet we are about to consider has a uniform field
filling the half space on each side of it. The solenoid, however, can be made as slender
as we please, and it would be strange indeed if a solenoid of vanishing diameter could

still cause a finite field everywhere. Perhaps you can think of a more conclusive
argument.

6.6 Change in B at a Current Sheet

In the example of Fig. 619 we had a solenoid constructed from a
single curved sheet of current. Let's look at something even simpler,
a flat. unbounded current sheet. You may think of this as a sheet
of copper of uniform thickness in which a current flows with constant
density and direction everywhere within the metal. In order to refer
to directions, let us locate the sheet in the xz plane, and let the current
flow in the x direction. As the sheet is supposed to be of infinite extent
with no edges, it is hard to draw a picture of it! We show a
broken-out fragment of the sheet in Fig. 6.21, in order to have something
to draw; you must imagine the rest of it extending over the
whole plane. The thickness of the sheet will not be very important,
finally, but we may suppose that it has some definite thickness t. If
the current density inside the metal is J in (esu/sec) /cm? then every
centimeter of height, in the z direction, includes a ribbon of current
amounting to Jt esu/sec. We call this the ``surface current density''
or ``sheet current density,'' and use the symbol :5 to distinguish it from
the volume current density J. The units of a7 are (esu/sec) /cm. If
we are not concerned with what goes on inside the sheet itself, 5 is
a useful quantity. It is :9 that determines the change in the magnetic
field from one side of the sheet to the other, as we shall see.

The field in Fig. 6.21 is not merely that due to the sheet alone.
Some other field in the z direction was present, from another source.
The total field, including the effect of the current sheet, is represented
by the B vectors drawn in front of and behind the sheet.

Consider the line integral of B around the rectangle 12341 in
Fig. 6.21. One of the long sides is in front of the surface, the other
behind it, with the short sides piercing the sheet. Let B; denote the
z component of the magnetic field immediately in front of the sheet,
B; the z component of the field immediately behind the sheet. We
mean here the field of all sources that may be around, including the
sheet itself. The line integra1_ofB around the long rectangle is simply
l(B,,+ - B2'). (Even if there were some other source which caused
a field component parallel to the short legs of the rectangle, these
legs themselves can be kept much shorter than the long sides, since
we assume the sheet is thin, in any case, compared to the scale of any
field variation.) The current enclosed by the rectangle is just log.
Hence we have the relation l(Bz+ - B2") = 4'rro9l/c, or

A current sheet of densitycg gives rise to a jump in that component
of B which is parallel to the surface and perpendicular toff This
may remind you of the change in electric field at a sheet of charge.
There, the perpendicular component of E is discontinuous, the magnitude
of the jump depending on the density of surface charge.

If the sheet is the only current source we have, then of course the
field is symmetrical about the sheet. B5' is 2773/0, and B; is
-2775/c. This is shown in Fig. 6.22a. Some other situations, in
which the effect of the current sheet is superposed on a field already
present from another source, are shown in Fig. 6.221) and c. Suppose
there are two sheets carrying equal and opposite surface currents, as
shown in cross section in Fig. 6.23, with no other sources around.
The direction of current flow is perpendicular to the plane of the
paper, out on the left and in on the right. The field between the sheets
is 4776] / c and there is no field at all outside. Something like this is
found when current is carried by two parallel ribbons or slabs, close
together compared to their width, as sketched in Fig. 6.24. Often bus
bars for distributing heavy currents in power stations are of this form.

The change in B takes place within the sheet, as we already remarked
in connection with Fig. 6.19. For the same 3, the thinner
the sheet, the more abrupt the transition. We looked at a situation
very much like this in Chaps. 1 and 2 when we examined the discontinuity
in the perpendicular component of E that occurs at a sheet
of surface charge. It was instructive then to ask about the force on
the surface charge, and we shall ask a similiar question here.

Consider a square portion of the sheet, 1 cm on a side. The current
included is equal to (9, the length of current path is 1 cm, and the
average field that acts on this current, assuming the current is uniformly
distributed through the thickness of the sheet, is %(Bz+ + B2').
Therefore the force on this portion of the current distribution is

5

Force on 1 cm? of sheet = %(Bz+ + B3'): (47)

In View of Eq. 46, we can substitute (B; - B2') /4rr for $7/c, so that
the force per square centimeter can be expressed in this way:

<35" + 32' )(Bz+ - B2')
2 477

§',;[<B.+>2 - (Bz_)2l (48)

Force per cm?

% p. 209
The force is perpendicular to the surface and proportional to the
area, like the stress caused by hydrostatic pressure. To make sure
of the sign, we can figure out the direction of the force in a particular
case, such as that in Fig. 6.23. The force is outward on each con-
ductor. It is as if the high field region were the region of high pres-
sure. We must remember, though, that it is only the component of
B parallel to the surface that counts in determining this force.

We have been considering an infinite flat sheet, but things are very
much the same in the immediate neighborhood of any curving
surface. Wherever the component of B parallel to the surface
changes from B1 to B2, from one side of the surface to the other, we

% p. 210
may conclude not only that there is a sheet of current flowing in the
surface, but that the surface must be under a perpendicular stress of
(B12 - B22)/8vrr, measured in dynes/cm2. This is one of the controlling
principles in magnetohydrodynamics, the study of electrically
conducting ffuids, a subject of interest both to electrical engineers
and to astrophysicists.

6.7 How the Fields Transform

A sheet of surface charge, if it is moving parallel to itself, constitutes
a surface current. If we have a uniform charge density of 0
on the surface, with the surface itself sliding along at speed 12, the
surface current density is just 3 = av. This simple idea will help us
to see how the electric and magnetic field quantities must change
when we transform from one inertial frame of reference to another.

Let's imagine two plane sheets of surface charge, parallel to the
xz plane as in Fig. 6.25. Again, we show fragments of surfaces only,
in the sketch; the surfaces are really infinite in extent. In the inertial
frame F, with coordinates $x$, $y$, and $z$, the density of surface charge
is a on one sheet and -0 on the other. In this frame the uniform
electric field E points in the positive y direction, and Gauss's law
assures us, as usual, that its strength is:

El, : 47m (49)

In this frame F the sheets are both moving in the positive x direction
with speed 00, so that we have a pair of current sheets. The
density of surface current is J, = ovo in one sheet, the negative of
that in the other. As in the arrangements in Fig. 6.21, the field between
two such current sheets is

B2 : 47r<~9, : 477000
c c

(50)

The inertial frame F ' is one that moves, as seen from F, with a speed
v in the positive x direction. VVhat fields will an observer in F'
measure? To answer this we need only find out what the sources look
like in F'.

In F' the x' velocity of the charge-bearing sheets is ué, given by
the velocity addition formula:

0 1 _ BOB (51)
There is a different Lorentz contraction of the charge density, in this
frame, exactly as in our earlier example of the moving line charge,
in Sec. 5.9. Repeating the argument we used then, the density in
the rest frame of the charges themselves is o(1 - v02/c2)1/2, or o/yo,
and therefore the density in the frame F' is

(52)

As usual, ya stands for (1 - 052/c2)'1/2. By means of Eq. 51 we

can eliminate ya, expressing it in terms of /30 and ,8, or yo and y.
When we do this, the result is:

0' = 01/(1 - Bo/3) (53)

% p. 212
The surface current density in the frame F' is therefore

3' =  = om ~ /2oB>c@15l = 0Y(Uo - v) (54)
1 - 30.3
We now know how the sources appear in frame F', so we know what
the fields in that frame must be. In saying this, we are again invoking
the postulate of relativity. The laws of physics must be the same in
all inertial frames, and that includes the formulas connecting electric

field with surface charge density, and magnetic field with surface
current density. It follows then that:

E1,' = 4770' = 1/ [47m --- (47:00  (55)
 

If we look back at the values of E,, and B', in Eqs. 49 and 50, we see
that our result can be written as follows:

E11, = l'(Ey - BB2)
B2, = Y(B2 - BE11)

If the sandwich of current sheets had been oriented parallel to the
xy plane, instead of the xz plane, we would have obtained relations
connecting E; with E2 and B1,, and B; with By and E2. Of course they
would have the same form as the relations above, but if you trace
the directions through, you will find that there are differences of sign,
following from the rules for the direction of B.

It remains to find how the field components in the direction of
motion change. We had already discovered in Sec. 5.5 that a longitudinal
component of E has the same magnitude in the two frames.
That this is true also of a longitudinal component of B can be seen
as follows. Suppose a longitudinal component of B, a B, component
in the arrangement in Fig. 6.25, is produced by a solenoid around the
x axis in frame F. The field strength inside a solenoid, as we know,
depends only on the current in the wire, I, which is charge per second,
and n, the number of turns of wire per centimeter of axial length.
In the frame F' the solenoid will be Lorentz-contracted so the number
of turns per centimeter in that frame will be greater. But the current,
as reckoned by the observer in F', will be reduced, since from his point
of view, the F observer who measured the current by counting the

number of electrons passing a point on the wire, per second, was
using a slow-running watch. The time dilation iust cancels the length

(57)

% p. 213
contraction in the product nI. Indeed any quantity of the dimensions
(longitudinal length) *1 >< (time)'1 is unchanged in a Lorentz trans-
formation. So B,' = B,.

Remember the point made early in Chap. 5, in the discussion
following Eq. 5.6: The transformation properties of the field are local
properties. The values of E and B at some space-time point in one
frame must uniquely determine the field components observed in
any other frame at that same space-time point. Therefore the fact
that we have used an especially simple kind of source (the parallel
uniformly charged sheets) in our derivation in no way compromises
the generality of our result. We have in fact arrived at the general
laws for the transformation of all components of the electric and
magnetic field, of whatever origin or configuration.

We give below the full list of transformations. All primed
quantities are measured in the frame F', which is moving in the positive
x direction with speed v as seen from F. Unprimed quantities
are the numbers which are the results of measurement in F. As usual,
,8 stands for 0/0 and y for (1 - ,82)'1/2.

E; = E, E,' = y(E,, - /33,) E,' = y(E, + /313,)
(58)

 

3:' = Bx Bu' = Y(By + .3152) B2' = Y(Bz - /3Eu)

The equations in the box confront us with an astonishing fact, their
symmetry with respect to E and B. If the printer had mistakenly
interchanged E's with B's, and y's with z's, the equations would come
out exactly the same! Yet our previous View had been that magnetism
is a kind of ``second-order'' eff"ect arising from relativistic
changes in the electric fields of moving charges. Certainly magnetic
phenomena as we find them in Nature are distinctly different from
electrical phenomena. The world around us is by no means symmetrical
with respect to electricity and magnetism. Nevertheless,
with the sources out of the picture, we find that the fields themselves,
E and B, are connected to one another in a highly symmetrical way.

It appears too that the electric and magnetic fields are in some
sense aspects, or components, of a single entity. We can speak of the
electromagnetic field, and we may think of E,,, E,,, E2, B,,, B,,, and B2 as
six components of the electromagnetic field. The same field viewed
in different inertial frames will be represented by different sets of
values for these components, somewhat as a vector is represented by
different components in different coordinate systems rotated with
respect to one another. However, the electromagnetic field so

% p. 214
something called a tensor. The totality of the equations in the box
forms the prescription for transforming the components of such a
tensor when we shift from one inertial frame to another. We are not
going to develop that mathematical language here. In fact, we shall
return now to our old way of talking about the electric field as a vector
field, and the magnetic field as another vector field coupled to the
first in a manner to be explored further in Chap. 7. To follow up on
this brief hint of the unity of the electromagnetic field as represented
in four-dimensional space-time, you will have to wait for a more
advanced course.

The transformations of Eq. 58 predict a strikingly simple relation
in a certain class of cases. Suppose that in one frame, say the ``un-

primed'' coordinates, the magnetic field B is zero everywhere. Then
the fields observed in the other frame are:
E,' = E, Ey' = yE,, E; yEz

' BYE11

(59)

B,' = 0 B1,' = ByEz B3'

This implies a certain relation between the electric and the magnetic
field everywhere in the ``primed'' frame, namely:

B,' : 0 By' : BE,' Bz' : -BE,,' (60)

Remembering that in this instance the velocity of the unprimed frame
is a vector in the -x' direction, as seen in the primed frame, we can
express the relation above as a vector cross-product, and thus obtain
a more general rule:

    
  

I

B' =  x E' (if B = 0 everywhere in some frame) (61)

C

 

Here v' means the velocity, as observed from the primed frame, of
that special frame in which B happens to be everywhere zero.
In exactly the same way, we deduce from Eq. 58 that if E = O

everywhere in one frame, which we shall call the unprimed frame.
then in another frame

 
   

  
 

E' = _.  x B' (if E = 0 everywhere in some frame)
c

(62)

 

Here, as in Eq. 61, v' is the velocity of the unprimed frame (in this
case the (me in which E is evervwhere zero) as seen from the orimed

% p. 215
frame. The parenthetical restrictions on Eqs. 61 and 62 are pretty
severe, of course. Often there will be no frame in which B is zero
everywhere, and no frame in which the electric charge density, and
therefore E, is zero everywhere.

Because Eq. 61 involves only quantities measured in the same
frame of reference, it is easy to apply, whenever the restriction is
met, to fields that vary in space.]'

A good example is the field of a point charge q moving with constant
velocity, the problem studied in Chap. 5. Take the unprimed
frame to be the frame in which the charge is at rest. In this frame,
of course, there is no magnetic field. Equation 61 tells us that in the
``lab'' frame, where we find the charge moving with speed 12, there
must be a magnetic field perpendicular to the electric field and to the
direction of motion. We have already worked out the exact form of
the electric field in this frame: We know the field is radial from the
instantaneous position of the charge, with a magnitude given by
Eq. 5.12. The magnetic field lines must be circles around the direction
of motion, as indicated crudely in Fig. 6.26. When the velocity
of the charge is high, so that y > 1, the radial ``spokes'' which are the
electric field lines are folded together into a thin disk. The circular
magnetic field lines are likewise concentrated in this disk. The magnitude
of B is then nearly equal to the magnitude of E. That is, the
magnitude of the magnetic field in gauss is almost exactly the same
as the magnitude of the electric field, at the same point and instant
of time, in statvolts/cm.

We have come a long way from Coulomb's law in the last two
chapters. Yet with each step we have only been following out consistently
the requirements of relativity and of the invariance of electric
charge. We can begin to see that the existence of the magnetic
field and its curiously symmetrical relationship to the electric field
is a necessary consequence of these general principles. We remind
the reader again that this was not at all the historical order of discovery
and elucidation of the laws of electromagnetism. One aspect
of the coupling between the electric and magnetic fields which is
implicit in Eq. 58 came to light in Michael Faraday's experiments
with changing electrical currents. That was seventy-five years before
anyone thought of writing down equations like those in the box.

'rFor spatially varying fields, the meaning of Eq. 58 is E'(x',y',z',t') = E(x,y,z,I), etc.

Thus if we want to compute the fields that will be observed everywhere in the primed
frame at the instant t', we have to use for each point (x',y',:') the time t that goes with
x'. y'. z'. t', as well as the $x$, $y$, and $z$ that go with x', y', z', t'. For instance, it is the
values of B; and B!' at that time t, at that point (x,y,z), that go on the right in the last

The experiments described in this paper were made with a view of
etermining whether or not an electrified body in motion produces
agnetic effects. There seems to be no theoretical ground upon which
3 can settle the question, seeing that the magnetic action of a con-
icted electric current may be ascribed to some mutual action between
e conductor and the current. Hence an experiment is of value. Pro-
ssor Maxwell, in his ' Treatise on Electricity,' Art. 770, has computed
e magnetic action of a moving electrified surface, but that the action
:ists has not yet been proved experimentally or theoretically.

The apparatus employed consisted of a vulcanite disc 21-1 centi-
etres in diameter and -5 centimetre thick which could be made to
svolve around a vertical axis with a velocity of 61- turns per second.
u either side of the disc at a distance of -6 cm. were fixed glass plates
wing a diameter of 38-9 cm. and a hole in the centre of 7-8 cm. The
ilcanite disc was gilded on both sides and the glass plates had an
inular ring of gilt on one side, the outside and inside diameters being
L-0 cm. and 8-9 cm. respectively. The gilt sides could be turned
»ward or from the revolving disc but were usually turned toward it so
rat the problem might be calculated more readily and there should

sually connected with the earth ; and the inside disc with an electric
ittery, by means of a point which approached within one-third of a
illimetre of the edge and turned toward it. As the edge was broad,

etween it and the edge. Between the electric battery and the disc,

6.8 Rowland's Experiment

As we remarked in Sec. 5.9, it was not obvious a hundred years
ago that a current flowing in a wire and a moving electrically charged
object are essentially alike as sources of magnetic field. The unified
view of electricity and magnetism which was then emerging from
Maxwell's work suggested that any moving charge ought to cause a
magnetic field, but experimental proof was hard to come by.

That the motion of an electrostatically charged sheet produces a
magnetic field was first demonstrated by Henry Rowland, the great
American physicist renowned for his perfection of the diffraction
grating. Rowland made many ingenious and accurate electrical
measurements, but none that taxed his experimental virtuosity as
severely as the detection and measurement of the magnetic field of
a rotating charged disk. The field to be detected was something like
lO'5 of the earth's field in magnitude---a formidable experiment,
even with today's instruments! In Fig. 6.27, you will see a sketch
of Rowland's apparatus and a reproduction of the first page of the
paper in which he described his experiment. Ten years before Hertz'
discovery of electromagnetic waves, Rowland's result gave inde-

pendent, if less dramatic, support to Maxwell's theory of the electromagnetic
field.

6.9 Electric Conduction in a Magnetic Field: The Hall Efiect
When a current flows in a conductor in the presence of a magnetic
field, the force (q/c)v x B acts directly on the moving charge car-
riers. Yet we observe a force on the conductor as a whole. Let's
see how this comes about. Figure 6.28a shows a section of a metal
bar in which a steady current is flowing. Driven by a field E, electrons
are drifting to the left with average speed 6, which has the same
meaning as the 17 in our discussion of conduction in Chap. 4. The
conduction electrons are indicated, very schematically, by the white
dots. The black dots are the positive ions which form the rigid framework
of the solid metal bar. Since the electrons are negative, we have
a current in the y direction. The current density J and the field E
are related by the conductivity of the metal, a, as usual: J = (IE.
There is no magnetic field in Fig. 6280 except that of the current
itself, which we shall ignore. Now an external field B in the x direction
is switched on. The state of motion immediately thereafter is

% p. 218
% p. 219
\/ll/I-41.1: u .llII(/ Lvnusnvuvuu 1. vvvuw 54!]

shown in Fig. 6.28b. The electrons are being deflected downward.
But since they cannot escape at the bottom of the bar, they simply
pile up there, until the surplus of negative charge at the bottom of the
bar and the corresponding excess of positive charge at the top creates
an electric field E, in which the upward force, of magnitude eE,,
exactly balances the downward force (e/c)t'>B. In the steady state
(which is attained very quickly!) the average motion is horizontal
again, and there existsin the interior of the metal this transverse
electric field E,, as observed in coordinates fixed in the metal lattice
(Fig. 6.28c). This field causes a downward force on the positive
ions. That is how the force, (- e/c)v x B, on the electrons is passed
on to the solid bar. The bar, of course, pushes on whatever is holding
it---or, if nothing is holding it, accelerates downward.

The existence of the transverse field E, can be demonstrated electrically
in a very direct way (Fig. 6.29). Wires are connected to
points P1 and P2 on opposite edges of the bar, the junction points
being carefully located so that they are at the same potential when
current is flowing in the bar and the field B is zero. The wires are
connected to a galvanometer. After the magnetic field B is switched
on, a steady current flows in this circuit, showing that P1 and P2 are
no longer at the same potential. In fact, P1 is positive, relative to P2
in the system we have just described.

This effect was discovered in 1879 by E. H. Hall, who was studying
under Rowland at Johns Hopkins. In those days no one understood
the mechanism of conduction in metals. The electron itself was un-
known. The Hall effect proved to be a most instructive phenomenon.

 

% p. 220
For modern research on electric conduction, especially in semicon-
ductors, Hall-effect measurements are indispensable.

We have seen that the magnetic field of a current, as well as the
force on a current-carrying conductor in an external field, are quite
independent of the details of the conduction process. The Hall
effect, however, reveals something about the charge carriers. Notice
that if the current in the bar in Fig. 6.28 had been due to positive
charges moving to the right, a transverse field E, of opposite direction
would have developed. Thus the sign of the ``Hall potential differ-
ence'' between P1 and P2 tells us whether the charge carriers are positive
or negative. Quantitatively, the magnitude of the transverse
field E, is determined by the equality

qEt : q B 01' E5 : B 

ole:
ole:

On the other hand, the average carrier velocity 6 is related to the
current density J by

J : nqfi (64)

where n is 'the number of charge carriers per unit volume, with charge
q in each. Combining Eqs. 63 and 64, we can eliminate 6:

E, = JB (65)

E,, J, and B can be measured in an arrangement like that in
Fig. 6.29. E, is just the potential difference between P1 and P2 divided
by the width of the bar; J the total current divided by the cross-
sectional area. Thus we can infer (1 /nqc). This factor is called the
``Hall coefficient'' for the substance. For many metals the Hall
coefficient has about the value you would expect if there is roughly
one conduction electron per atom, with the sign of the effect indicating
that the charge carriers are indeed negative. But some metals
have Hall coefficients of the opposite sign! This remained a baffiing

paradox until it was explained by the quantum theory of electrons
in metals.

The coil has 15 turns and a bottom edge length of 8 cm. The system is balanced

Here e is the electronic charge 4.8 X 10-10 esu, h 2 l0'27 erg-sec is Planck's
constant divided by 27r, and m is the electron mass. What current is this circulating
charge equivalent to? What is the strength in gauss of the magnetic
field at the proton which arises from the electron's motion?

6.6 The leads that carry a direct current of 5000 amp to a large magnet
are constructed as follows: A solid aluminum rod 5 cm in diameter is surrounded
by a return lead in the shape of an aluminum cylinder of 7 cm inside
diameter and 9 cm outside diameter. (The annular space between the rod and
the cylinder is filled with flowing oil which serves to remove the heat.) In each
of the conductors the current density will be practically constant over the cross
section of the conductor. Calculate and plot on a graph the magnitude of the
magnetic field B, in gauss, as a function of radius in centimeters from the axis
to a point outside the outer conductor. (The presence of the aluminum itself .
and the oil, does not afiect the magnetic field---see the remark in Sec. 6.1.)

6.7 A solenoid is made by winding a single layer of No. 14 copper wire on
a cylindrical form 6 cm in diameter. There are 5 turns per centimeter and the
length of the solenoid is 30 cm. Consulting wire tables, we find that No. 14
copper wire, which has a diameter of 0.163 cm, has a resistance of 0.010 ohms
per meter at 75°C. (We expect this coil to run hot!) If this solenoid is connected
across a 24-volt generator, what will be the magnetic field strength in the
solenoid, in gauss, and the power dissipation, in watts?

Ans. 520 gauss; 2000 watts.

6.8 In the neighborhood of the origin in the coordinate system x, y, 2, there
is an electric field E of magnitude 100 statvolts/cm, pointing in a direction
that makes angles of 30° with the x axis, 60° with the y axis. The frame F'
has its axes parallel to those just described, but is moving, relative to the first
frame, with a speed 0.60 in the positive y direction. Find the direction and
magnitude of the electric field which will be reported by an observer in the
frame F'. What magnetic field does this observer report?

6.9 An ocean current flows at a speed of 2 knots (about 1 meter/sec)
in a region where the vertical component of the earth's magnetic field is
0.35 gauss. The conductivity of sea water in that region is 0.04 (ohm cm)".
On the assumption that there is no other horizontal component of E than the
motional term (v/c) x B, find the density of horizontal electric current in
amperes per square meter. If you were to carry a bottle of sea water through
the earth's field at this speed, would such a current be flowing in it?

6.10 For speeds small compared to c, the field transformations can be
written in a very simple form

E'=E+%xB B'=B-%xE

where v is the velocity with which the ``primed'' coordinate system is moving
as seen from the ``unprimed'' frame. Let v = iBc to correspond to the particular
situation underlying Eqs. 58, and show that the above equations give
results consistent with Eqs. 58 in the approximation (1 - 32)"? 2. 1. Let
the primed frame be that of a jet aircraft ffying in the direction of magnetic
north in a region where the earth's magnetic field has a magnitude of 0.4 gauss
and makes an angle of 30° with the vertical, pointing downward as in the
Northern Hemisphere. What is the direction of the extra component of electric
field, in aircraft coordinates, which arises from the motion through the
magnetic field? What is its magnitude in statvolts/cm?

6.11 Prove that E - B is an invariant with respect to Lorentz transforma-
tions, using Eqs. 58. That is, prove that if E - B has a certain value in one
inertial frame it has the same value in all inertial frames. Prove similarly that
E2 - B2 is an invariant with respect to Lorentz transformations.

6.12 See if you can devise a vector potential that will correspond to a uniform
field in the z direction: B, = 0, B,, = O, Bz : B0.

6.13 Notice that the vector potential A is related to the magnetic field B
the way B is related to the current density J. That is, curl A = B, while
curl B : (4'rr/c)J. What statement about A corresponds to the statement
that the line integral of B around any closed path equals 477/c times the current
enclosed by the path? Consider the magnetic field of a long cylindrical
rod of metal carrying a current uniformly distributed over its cross section, and
flowing parallel to the axis. You know what the field of such a current distribution
is. Draw a picture of the current distribution and the magnetic field
lines. Now, using the analogy just mentioned, find a vector potential to go
with the field of an infinitely long solenoid. It is worth noting that in this case
the vector potential itself is not zero in a region where the magnetic field is zero.

6.14 Since parallel current filaments attract one another, one might think
that a current flowing in a solid rod like the inner conductor in Prob. 6.6 would
tend to concentrate near the axis of the rod. That is, the conduction electrons,
instead of distributing themselves evenly as usual over the interior of the metal,
would crowd in toward the axis and most of the current would be there. What
do you think prevents this from happening? Ought it happen to any extent
at all? Can you suggest an experiment to detect such an effect, if it should
exist?

6.15 Consider two electrons in a cathode-ray tube which are moving on
parallel paths. side by side, at the same speed 0. The distance between them,
a distance measured at right angles to their velocity, is 1. What is the force
that acts on one of them, owing to the presence of the other, as observed in the
laboratory frame? If 0 were very small compared to c, you could answer e2/r2
and let it go at that. But 0 isn't small, so you have to be careful.

(a) The easiest way to get the answer is this: Go to a frame of reference
moving with the electrons. In that frame the two electrons are at rest, the

35

% p. 224
distance between them is still r (why?), and the force is just e2/r2. Now transform
the force into the laboratory frame, using the force transformation law.
Eq. 5.31. (Be careful about which is the primed system; is the force in the lab
frame greater or less than the force in the electron frame?)

(b) It should be possible to get the same answer working entirely in the lab
frame. In the lab frame, at the instantaneous position of electron 1, there are
both electric and magnetic fields arising from electron 2 (see Fig. 6.26). Calcu-
late the net force on electron 1, which is moving through these fields with
speed 0, and show that you get the same result as in (a). Make a diagram to
show the directions of the fields and forces.

(0) In the light of this, what can you say about the force between two side-
by-side moving electrons, in the limit 1) \rightarrow c?

Chapter 7 Electromagnetic Induction
and Maxwell's Equations

7.1 Faraday '.s Discovery

1. The power which electricity of tension possesses of causing an opposite
electrical state in its vicinity has been expressed by the general term Induc-
tion; which, as it has been received into scientific language, may also, with
propriety, be used in the same general sense to express the power which
electrical currents may possess of inducing any particular state upon matter
in their immediate neighbourhood, otherwise indifferent. It is with this
meaning that I purpose using it in the present paper.

2. Certain effects of the induction of electrical currents have already been
recognised and described: as those of magnetization; Ampere's experiments
of bringing a copper disc near to a flat spiral; his repetition with electromagnets
of Arago's extraordinary experiments, and perhaps a few others.
Still it appeared unlikely that these could be all the effects which induction
by currents could produce; especially as, upon dispensing with iron, almost
the whole of them disappear, whilst yet an infinity of bodies, exhibiting
definite phenomena of induction with electricity of tension, still remain to
be acted upon by the induction of electricity in motion.

3. Further: Whether Ampere's beautiful theory were adopted, or any
other, or whatever reservation were mentally made, still it appeared very
extraordinary, that as every electric current was accompanied by a corresponding
intensity of magnetic action at right angles to the current, good
conductors of electricity, when placed within the sphere of this action, should
not have any current induced through them, or some sensible effect produced
equivalent in force to such a current.

4. These considerations, with their consequence, the hope of obtaining
electricity from ordinary magnetism, have stimulated me at various times
to investigate experimentally the inductive effect of electric currents. I lately
arrived at positive results; and not only had my hopes fulfilled, but obtained
a key which appeared to me to open out a full explanation of Arago's magnetic
phenomena, and also to discover a new state, which may probably have
great influence in some of the most important effects of electric currents.

5. These results I purpose describing, not as they were obtained, but in
such a manner as to give the most concise View of the whole.

So begins Michael Faraday's account of the discovery of electromagnetic
induction. This passage was part of a paper Faraday presented
in 1831. It is quoted from his Experimental Researches in
Electricity, published in London in 1839. There follows in the paper
a description of a dozen or more experiments, through which Faraday

226

% p. 227
brought to light every essential feature of the production of electric
efiects by magnetic action.

By ``electricity of tension'' Faraday meant electrostatic charges,
and the induction he refers to in the first sentence involves nothing
more than we have studied in Chap. 3: The presence of a charge
causes a redistribution of charges on conductors nearby. Faraday's
question was, why does not an electric current cause another current
in nearby conductors?

The production of magnetic fields by electric currents had been
thoroughly investigated after Oersted's discovery. The familiar
laboratory source of these ``galvanic'' currents was the voltaic battery.
The most sensitive detector of such currents was a galvanometer. It
consisted of a magnetized needle pivoted like a compass needle or
suspended by a weak fiber between two coils of wire. Sometimes
another needle, outside the coil but connected rigidly to the first
needle, was used to compensate the influence of the earth's magnetic
field (Fig. 7.1a). The sketches in Fig. 7.1b through e represent a
few of Faraday's induction experiments. You must read his own
account, one of the classics of experimental science, to appreciate
the resourcefulness with which he pressed the search, the alert and
open mind with which he viewed the evidence.

In his early experiments Faraday was puzzled to find that a steady
current had no detectable effect on a nearby circuit. He constructed
various coils of wire, of which Fig. 7.1a shows an example, winding
two conductors so that they should lie very close together while still
separated by cloth or paper insulation. One conductor would form
a circuit with the galvanometer. Through the other he would send
a strong current from a battery. There was, disappointingly, no de-
ffection of the galvanometer. But in one of these experiments he
noticed a very slight disturbance of the galvanometer when the current
was switched on and another when it was switched off. Pursuing
this lead. he soon established beyond doubt that currents in other
conductors are induced, not by a steady current, but by a changing
current. One of Faraday's brilliant experimental tactics at this stage
was to replace his galvanometer, which he realized was not a good
detector for a brief pulse of current, by a simple small coil in which
he put an unmagnetized steel needle (Fig. 7.lb). He found that the
needle was left magnetized by the pulse of current induced when the
primary current was switched on---and it could be magnetized in the

opposite sense by the current pulse induced when the primary circuit
was broken.

% p. 228
Here is his own description of another experiment:

In the preceding experiments the wires were placed near to each other.
and the contact of the inducing one with the battery made when the inductive
effect was required; but as the particular action might be supposed to be
exerted only at the moments of making and breaking contact, the induction
was produced in another way. Several feet of copper wire were stretched
in wide zigzag forms, representing the letter W, on one surface of a broad
board; a second wire was stretched in precisely similar forms on a second
board, so that when brought near the first, the wires should everywhere
touch, except that a sheet of thick paper was interposed. One of these wires
was connected with the galvanometer, and the other with a voltaic battery.
The first wire was then moved towards the second, and as it approached, the
needle was deflected. Being then removed, the needle was deflected in the
opposite direction. By first making the wires approach and then recede,
simultaneously with the vibrations of the needle, the latter soon became very
extensive; but when the wires ceased to move from or towards each other,
the galvanometer needle soon came to its usual position.

As the wires approximated, the induced current was in the contrary direction
to the inducing current. As the wires receded, the induced current was
in the same direction as the inducing current. When the wires remained
stationary, there was no induced current.

In this chapter we study the electromagnetic interaction that
Faraday explored in those experiments. From our present view-
point, induction can be seen as a natural consequence of the force on
a charge moving in a magnetic field. In a limited sense, we can derive
the Induction Law from what we already know. In following this
course we again depart from the historical order of development, but
we do so (borrowing Faraday's own words from the end of the
passage first quoted) to give the most concise view of the whole.

7.2 A Conducting Rod Moves through a Uniform Magnetic Field
Figure 7.2a shows a straight piece of wire, or slender metal rod,
supposed to be moving at constant velocity v in a direction perpendicular
to its length. Pervading the space through which the rod
moves there is a uniform magnetic field B, constant in time. This
could be supplied by a large solenoid enclosing the entire region of
the diagram. The reference frame F with coordinates x, y, z is the
one in which this solenoid is at rest. In the absence of the rod there
is no electric field in that frame, only the uniform magnetic field B.
The rod, being a conductor, contains charged particles that will
move if a force is applied to them. Any charged particle that is
carried along with the rod, such as the particle of charge q in Fig. 7.2b.

% p. 229
necessarily moves through the magnetic field B and does therefore
experience a force

f=%vxB (1)

With B and v directed as shown in Fig. 7.2, the force is in the positive
x direction if q is a positive charge, and in the opposite direction for
the negatively charged electrons that are in fact the mobile charge
carriers in most conductors. The consequences will be the same,
whether negatives or positives, or both, are mobile.

When the rod is moving at constant speed and things have settled
down to a steady state, the force f given by Eq. 1 must be balanced,
at every point inside the rod, by an equal and opposite force. This
can only arise from an electric field in the rod. The electric field
develops in this way: The force f pushes negative charges toward one
end of the rod, leaving the other end positively charged. This goes
on until these separated charges themselves cause an electric field E
such that, everywhere in the interior of the rod,

qE = -f (2)

Then the motion of charge relative to the rod ceases. This charge
distribution causes an electric field outside the rod, as well as inside.
The field outside looks something like that of separated positive and
negative charges with the difference that the charges are not concentrated
entirely at the ends of the rod but are distributed along it. The
external field is sketched in Fig. 7.3a. Figure 7.31) is an enlarged view
of the positively charged end of the rod, showing the charge distribution
on the surface and some field lines both outside and inside the
conductor. That is the way things look, at any instant of time, in
frame F.

Let us observe this system from a frame F' that moves with the rod.
Ignoring the rod for the moment, we see in this frame F', indicated in
Fig. 7.2c, a magnetic field B' (not much different from B if v is small)
together with a uniform electric field, as given by Eq. 6.62,

E'=-i)(B'=1XB' 

c c
When we add the rod to this system, all we are doing is putting a
stationary conducting rod into a uniform electric field. There will

be a redistribution of charge on the surface of the rod so as to make
the electric field zero inside, as in the case of the metal box of Fig. 3.6,

% p. 230
or of any other conductor in an electric field. The presence of the
magnetic field B' has no influence on this static charge distribution.
Figure 7.4a shows some electric field lines in the frame F', and in the
magnified view of the end of the rod in Fig. 7.4b we observe that the
electric field inside the rod is zero.

Except for the Lorentz contraction, which is second order in 0/0,
the charge distribution seen at one instant in frame F, Fig. 7.31:, is the
same as that seen in F'. The electric fields differ because the field in
Fig. 7.3 is that of the surface charge distribution alone, while the
electric field we see in Fig. 7.4 is the field of the surface charge
distribution plus the uniform electric field that exists in that frame
of reference. An observer in F says: ``Inside the rod there has developed
an electric field E = - (v/c) x B, exerting a force qE -_-
-q(v/c) x B which just balances the force q(v/c) x B that would
otherwise cause any charge q to move along the rod.'' An observer
in F' says: ``Inside the rod there is no electric field, and although there
is a uniform magnetic field here, no force arises from it because no
charges are moving.'' Each account is correct.

7.3 A Loop Moves through a Nonuniform Magnetic Field

What if we made a rectangular loop of wire, as shown in Fig. 7.5,
and moved it at constant speed through the uniform field B? To
predict what will happen, we need only ask ourselves---adopting the
frame F'-what would happen if we put such a loop into a uniform
electric field. Obviously two opposite 'sides of the rectangle would
acquire some charge, but that would be all. Suppose, however, that
the field B in the frame F, though constant in time, is not uniform in
space. To make this vivid, we show in Fig. 7.6 the field B with a short
solenoid as its source.» This solenoid, together with the battery that
supplies its constant current, is fixed near the origin in the frame F.
(We said earlier there is no electric field in F; if we really use a
solenoid of finite resistance to provide the field, there will be an electric
field associated with the battery and this circuit. It is irrelevant
to our problem and can be ignored. Or we can pack the whole
solenoid, with its battery, inside a metal box.)

Now, with the loop moving with speed 12 in the y direction, in the
frame F, let its position at some instant t be such that the magnetic
field strength is B1 at the left side of the loop and B2 along the right
side (Fig. 7.6). Let f denote the force which acts on a charge q that
rides along with the loop. This force is a function of position on the
loop, at this instant of time. Let's evaluate the line integral of f,
taken around the whole loop: On the two sides of the loop which lie
parallel to the direction of motion, f is perpendicular to the path

 

% p. 233
element ds, so these give nothing. Taking account of the contributions
from the other two sides, each of length w, we have:

ff-ds = "7"(B1 - B2>w (4)

If we imagine a charge q to move all around the loop, in a time
short enough so that the position of the loop has not changed ap-
preciably, then Eq. 4 gives the work done by the force f. The work
done per unit charge is (1/q)ff - ds. We call this quantity electromotive
force. We use the symbol 8 for it, and often shorten the name
to ``emf.'' 8 has the same dimensions as electric potential and is
measured in statvolts, or ergs per unit charge, in the CGS system.

2, = if r - ds (5)
q

The term electromotive force was introduced earlier, in Sec. 4.10. It
was defined as the work per unit charge involved in moving a charge
around a circuit containing a voltaic cell. We now broaden the
definition of emf to include any influence that causes charge to
circulate around a closed path. If the path happens to be a physical
circuit with resistance R, then the emf 8 will cause a current to flow
according to Ohm's law: I = 8/R. In the particular case we are con-

sidering, f is the force that acts on a charge moving in a magnetic
field, and 8 has the magnitude:

8 = $031 - B2) (6)

The electromotive force given by Eq. 6 is related in a very simple way
to the rate of change of magnetic flux through the loop. By the magnetic
flux through a loop we mean the surface integral of B over a
surface which has the loop for its boundary. The flux <1) through the

closed curve or loop C in Fig. 7.7a is given by the surface integral
of B over S1:

'ptsn = SIB ' dal (7)

We could draw infinitely many surfaces bounded by C. Figure 7.7b
shows another one, S2. Why don't we have to specify which surface
to use in computing the flux? It doesn't make any difference because
fB - da will have the same value for all such surfaces. Let's take a
minute to settle this point once and for all. The flux through S2 will

be IS B - dag. Notice that we let the vector dag stick out from the
2

% p. 234
 

upper side of S2, to be consistent with our choice of side of S1. This
will give a positive number if the net flux through C is upward.

q)(S,_,) : S2B'da2 

We learned in Sec. 6.2 that the magnetic field has zero divergence:
div B = 0. It follows then from Gauss's theorem that if S is any
closed surface (``balloon''), and Vis the volume inside it:

fSB-da=fVdivBdv=0 (9)

Apply this to the closed surface, rather like a kettle drum, formed by
joining our S1 and S2, as in Fig. 7.7c. On S2 the outward normal is

opposite to the vector da2 we used in calculating the flux through C.
Thus

0=fSB-da=fB-dal +J'B-(-da2)
or (10)
S1B'da1 = S2B'da2

This shows that it doesn't matter which surface we use to compute
the flux through C.

This is all pretty obvious if you realize that div B = 0 implies a
kind of spatial conservation of flux. As much flux enters any volume
as leaves it. (We are considering the situation in the whole space at
one instant of time.) It is often helpful to visualize ``tubes'' of flux.
A flux tube (Fig. 7.8) is a surface at every point on which the magnetic
field line lies in the plane of the surface. It is a surface through
which no flux passes, and we can think of it as containing a certain
amount of flux, as a telephone cable contains wires. Through any
closed curve drawn tightly around a flux tube, the same flux passes.
This could be said about the electric field E only for regions where
there is no electric charge, since div E = 477p. The magnetic field
always has zero divergence everywhere.

Returning now to the moving rectangular loop, let us find the rate
of change of flux through the loop. In time dt the loop moves a distance
1; dt. This changes in two ways the total flux through the loop,
which is fB - da over a surface spanning the loop. As you can see
in Fig. 7.9, flux is gained at the right, in amount B2wv dt, while an
amount of flux Blwv dt is lost at the left. Hence dd), the change in
flux through the loop in time dt, is

d<I>= -(B1-B2)wvdt (ll)

% p. 235
Comparing Eq. 11 with Eq. 6, we see that, in this case at least, the
electromotive force can be expressed as:

1 dd)

8 _ - g? (12)

We can show that this holds quite generally, for a loop of any shape
moving in any manner. The loop C in Fig. 7.10 occupies the position
C1 at time t, and it is moving so that it occupies the position C2 at
time t + dt. A particular element of the loop ds has been transported
with velocity v to its new position. S indicates a surface that spans

the loop at time t. The flux through the loop at this instant of time is

<I>(t) =fSB-da (13)

The magnetic field B comes from sources that are stationary in our
frame of reference and remains constant in time, at any point fixed
in this frame. At time t + dt a surface which spans the loop is the
original surface S, left fixed in space, augmented by the ``rim'' dS.

(Remember, we are allowed to use any surface spanning the loop to
compute the flux through it.) Thus:

€I>(t+ dt) =f

S+dSB-da = <I>(t) +LSB-da (14)
Hence the change in flux, in time dt, is just the flux through the ``rim''
:15, ds B - da. On the rim, an element of surface area da can be ex-

pressed as (v dt) x ds, so the integral over the surface dS can be
written as an integral around the path C, in this way:

d<I)=fdSB-da:fCB-[(vdt)xds] (15)

Since dt is a constant for the integration, we can factor it out and
have:

%'=fCB-(vxds) (16)

According to the rule for the scalar triple product (Vol. I, p. 38,
Eq. 52) we have the identity: a- (b x c) = - (b x a) - c. Using
this to rearrange the integrand in Eq. 16, we have:

%=-fC(vxB)-ds (17)

 

% p. 236
  

Now the force on a charge q which is carried along by the loop is just
q(v x B) /c, so the electromotive force, which is the line integral
around the loop of the force per unit charge, is just

2-.=%fC(vxB)-ds (18)

Comparing Eq. 17 with Eq. 18 we get the simple relation already
given in Eq. 12, but valid now for arbitrary shape and motion of the
loop. (We did not even have to assume that v is the same for all
parts of the loop!) In summary, the line integral around a moving
loop of f/q, the force per unit charge, is just --- 1/c times the rate of
change of flux through the loop.

The sense of the line integral and the direction in which flux is
called positive are to be related by a right-hand-thread rule. For
instance, in Fig. 7.6, the flux is upward through the loop and is
decreasing. Taking the minus sign in Eq. 12 into account, our rule
would predict an electromotive force which would tend to drive a
positive charge around that loop in a counterclockwise direction, as
seen looking down on the loop (Fig. 7.11).

There is a better way to look at this question of sign and direction.
Notice that if a current should flow in the direction of the induced
electromotive force, in the situation shown in Fig. 7.11, this current
itself would create some flux through the loop in a direction to
counteract the assumed flux change. That is an essential physical
fact, and not the consequence of an arbitrary convention about signs
and directions. It is a manifestation of the tendency of systems to
resist change. In this context it is traditionally called Lenz's law.

Another example of Lenz's law is illustrated in Fig. 7.12. The
conducting ring is falling in the magnetic field of the coil. The flux
through the ring is downward and is increasing in magnitude. To
counteract this change, some new flux upward is needed. It would
take a current flowing around the ring in the direction of the arrows
to produce such flux. Lenz's law assures us that the induced emf will
be in the right direction to cause such a current.

If the electromotive force causes current to flow in the loop which
is shown in Figs. 7.6 and 7.11, as it will if the loop has a finite resist-
ance, some energy will be dissipated in the wire. What supplies this
energy? To answer that, consider the force that acts on the current
in the loop if it flows in the sense indicated by the arrow in Fig. 7.11.
The conductor on the right, in the field B2, will experience a force
toward the right, while the opposite side of the loop, in the field B1,

% p. 237
will be pushed toward the left. But B1 is greater than B2, so the net
force on the loop is toward the left, opposing the motion. To keep
the loop moving at constant speed some external agency has to do
work, and the energy thus invested eventually shows up as heat in
the wire. Imagine what would happen if I.enz's law were violated,
or if the force on the loop were to act in a direction to assist the
motion of the loop!

A very common element in electrical machinery and electrical instruments
is a loop or coil that rotates in a magnetic field. Let's apply
what we have just learned to the system shown in Fig. 7.13, a single
loop rotating at constant speed in a magnetic field that is approximately
uniform. The mechanical essentials, shaft, bearings, drive,
etc., are not drawn. The field B is provided by the two fixed coils.
Suppose the loop rotates with angular velocity on, in radians/sec. If
its position at any instant is specified by the angle 0, then 0 = wt + 01,

% p. 238
where the constant oz is simply the position of the loop at t = 0. The
component of B perpendicular to the plane of the loop is B sin 0.
Therefore the flux through the loop at time t is

CD(t) = SB sin (oat + OL) (19)

where S is the area of the loop. For the induced electromotive force
we then have: i
l dll) _ _ SBoo

s;=---

cos (wt + or) (20)

If the loop instead of being closed is connected through slip rings to
external wires, as shown in Fig. 7.13, we can detect at these terminals
a sinusoidally alternating potential difference.

A numerical example may clear up any question about units.
Suppose the magnetic field strength B is 500 gauss, the speed of rotation
30 revolutions per second, the loop area 100 cm2. Then
00 = 2n x 30, or 188 radians/sec, and the amplitude, that is, the
maximum magnitude, of the oscillating electromotive force is

= 3.1 X 10-4 gauss-cm, or statvolt (21)

Since 8 is work per unit charge, it ought to come out in statvolts in
the CGS system we are using. Notice that the units in Eq. 21 reduce
to gauss-centimeters. Electric field strength E and magnetic field
strength B have the same dimensions in the Gaussian CGS system.
For instance, in a transformation formula like E' = (v/c) x B, we
multiply a magnetic field strength by the dimensionless ratio 0/0 to
obtain an electric field strength. (The unit of electric field strength,
statvolts per centimeter, happens not to have been given a name all
its own, like gauss.) Thus 1 gauss-cm translates directly to 1 (stat-
vo1t/ cm) -cm, that is, 1 statvolt. In ordinary volts, the ``practical''
unit, the amplitude of the electromotive force in this example
amounts to 3.1 X 10'4 X 300, or 0.093 volt.

7.4 A Stationary Loop with the Field Source Moving

We can, if we like, look at the events depicted in Fig. 7.6 from a
frame of reference that is moving with the loop. That can't change
the physics, only the words we use to describe it. Let F', with coordinates
x', y', z', be the frame attached to the loop, which we now regard

% p. 239
as stationary (Fig. 7.14). The coil and battery, stationary in frame F,
are moving in the - y' direction with velocity v' = -v. Let Bi and
B5 be the magnetic fields measured at the two ends of the loop by
observers in F' at some instant t'. At these positions there will be
an electric field in F'. Equation 6.62 tells us that

_v'xBi vxBi

E': :

1 c c (22)
E,_ v'xBé_vxBé

2__ c _ c

For observers in F' this is a genuine electric field. It is not an
electrostatic field. The line integral of E' around any closed path in
F' is not generally zero. In fact, the line integral of E' around the
rectangular loop is:

fE' - ds' = 322035 _ 13;) (23)

We can call the line integral in Eq. 23 the electromotive force 8' on
this path. If a charged particle moves once around the path, 8' is
the work done on it, per unit charge. 8' is related to the rate of

% p. 240
change of flux through the loop. To see this, note that while the loop
itself is stationary, the magnetic field pattern is now moving with the
velocity -v of the source. Hence for the flux lost or gained at either
end of the loop, in a time interval dt', we get a result similar to Eq. 11,
and we conclude that

,_1d<I>'-
8_cdt'

(24)

We can summarize as follows the descriptions in the two frames of
reference, F, in which the source of B is at rest, and F', in which the
loop is at rest: is

An observer in F says, ``We have here a magnetic field which,
though it is not uniform spatially, is constant in time. There is no
electric field. That wire loop over there is moving with velocity v
through the magnetic field, so the charges in it are acted on by a force
(v/ c) x B dynes per unit charge. The line integral of this force-per-
unit-charge, taken around the whole loop is the electromotive force 8
and it is equal to - ( l/c) (d<I>/dt). The flux <1) is fB - da over a surface
S which, at some instant of time t by my clock, spans the loop.''

An observer in F' says, ``This loop is stationary and only an electric
field could cause the charges in it to move. But there is in fact an
electric field E'. It seems to be caused by that magnetlike object
which happens at this moment to be whizzing by with a velocity -v,
producing at the same time a rather strong magnetic field B'. The
electric field is such that fE' -_ds' around this stationary loop is not
zero but instead is equal to 4''; 1/0 time_s_,l the rate of change of flux
through the loop, d<I>'/dt'. The flux <1)' is JB' - da' over a surface
spanning the loop, the values of B' to be measured all over this surface
at some one instant t', by my clock.''

Our conclusions so far are relativistically exact. They hold for
any speed 0 g c provided we observe scrupulously the distinctions
between B and B', t and t', etc. If v < c, so that u'3/c2 can be

neglected, B' will be practically equal to B, and we can safely ignore
also the distinction between t and t'.

7.5 A Universal Law of Induction

Let's carry out three experiments with the apparatus shown in
Fig. 7.15. The tables are on wheels so that they can be easily moved.
A sensitive galvanometer has been connected to our old rectangular
loop, and to increase any induced electromotive force we put several
turns of wire in the loop rather than one. Frankly though. our sen-

% p. 241
sitivity might still be marginal, with the feeble source of magnetic

field pictured. Perhaps you can devise a more practical version of
the experiment in the laboratory.

Experiment I. With constant current in the coil and table 1 station-
ary, table 2 moves toward the right with speed 17. The galvanometer

deflects. We are not surprised; we have already analyzed this situation
in Sec. 7.3 above.

Experiment 11. With constant current in the coil and table 2 station-
ary, table 1 moves to the left with speed 12. The galvanometer
deflects. This doesn't surprise us either. We have just discussed the
equivalence of Experiments I and II, an equivalence which is an example
of Lorentz invariance or, for the low speeds of our tables,
Galilean invariance. We know that in both experiments the deflec-

tion of the galvanometer can be related to the rate of change of flux
of B through the loop.

Experiment 111. Both tables remain at rest, but we vary the current
I in the coil by sliding the contact K along the resistance strip. We
do this in such a way that the rate of decrease of the field B at the loop

is the same as it was in Experiments I and II. Does the galvanometer
deflect?

% p. 242
For an observer stationed at the loop on table 2 and measuring
the magnetic field in that neighborhood as a function of time and
position, there is no way to distinguish between Experiments 1, II,
and III. Imagine a black cloth curtain between the two tables.
Although there might be minor differences between the field configurations
for II and III, an observer who did not know what was
behind the curtain could not decide, on the basis of local B measurements
alone, which case it was. Therefore if the galvanometer did
not respond with the same deflection in Experiment III, it would
mean that the relation between the magnetic and electric fields in a
region depends on the nature of a remote source. Two magnetic
fields essentially similar in their local properties would have associated
in one case, but not in the other, an electric field with
E - ds 7E 0.

We find by experiment that III is equivalent to I and II. The
galvanometer defiects, by the same amount as before. Faraday's
experiments were the first to demonstrate this fundamental fact.
The electromotive force we observe depends only on the rate of
change of the flux of B, and not on anything else. We can state as a
universal relation Faraday's Law of Induction:

If C is some closed curve, stationary in coordinates
x, y, z, if S is a surface spanning C, and B(x,y,z,t) is the
magnetic field measured in x, y, z, at any time t, then

_  (25)

 

Using the vector derivative curl, we can express this law in differential
form. If the relation

_ ii .
CEds__CdtfSBda (26)

is true for any curve C and spanning surface S, as our law asserts, it
follows that at any point

curl E = _ L111 (27)

cdt

To show that Eq. 27 follows from Eq. 26, we proceed as usual to let C
shrink down around a point, which we take to be a nonsingular

point for the function B. Then in the limit the variation of B over the

% p. 243
small patch of surface a that spans C will be negligible and the surface
integral will approach simply B - a. Now by definition (Eq. 2.76)

the limit approached by ICE - ds as the patch shrinks is a - curl E.
Thus we have, in the limit,

a-curlE:-%%(B-a)=a-(---:-%) (28)

Since this holds for any infinitesimal a, it must be thatf

curl E = _ id_B (29)

0 dt
Recognizing that B may depend on position as well as time we shall

write BB/at in place of dB/dt. We have then these two entirely
equivalent statements of the law of induction:

fCE-ds= ---%%fSB-da

or (30)

curlE= ---1-Q

cat

In Eq. 30 the electric field E is to be expressed in absolute electrostatic
units, that is, statvolts per centimeter, and B is to be measured

in gauss. The electromotive force 8 = fc E - ds will be given in stat-

volts. In practical calculations we often prefer to express electromotive
force in volts, while retaining gauss for the unit of magnetic
field strength. Recalling that l statvolt is equivalent to 300 volts,

we see that the relation between 8 and the rate of change of flux
must be:

e: E-d=_(1o-8)i B-da
/ Li K /"Jr \

(volts) (volts/cm)< (cm) (sec) (gauss) (cm?)

___ _ ( lO~8)id<ll: (gauzzgcmz)

(31)

The differential expression, curl E = - (1/c) BB/at, brings out
rather plainly the point we tried to make earlier about the local nature

Tlf that isn't obvious, note that choosing a in the x direction will establish that

(curl E), = - -l dB'
c

, and so on.

% p. 244
of the field relations. The variation in time of B in a neighborhood
completely determines curl E there-nothing else matters. That
does not completely determine E itself, of course. Without affecting
this relation any electrostatic field, with curl E = 0, could be
superposed.

As a concrete example, suppose coils like those in Fig. 7.13 are
supplied with 60 cycle/sec alternating current, instead of direct
current. The current and the magnetic field vary as sin (2-rr - 60 - t),
or sin 377t. Suppose the amplitude of the current is such that the
magnetic field B in the central region reaches a maximum value of
50 gauss. We want to investigate the induced electric field, and the
electromotive force, on the circular path 10 cm in radius shown in

Fig. 7.16. We may assume that the field B is practically uniform in
the interior of this circle, at any instant of time.

B = 50 sin 377: (32)

% p. 245
B is in gauss and t in seconds. The flux through the loop C is
(I) = arr2B = 77 x 102 x 50 sin 377t

= 15,700 sin 377t (gauss-cm?) (33)
Using Eq. 31 to calculate the electromotive force in volts,
8 = - (10'8)% = - (10'8) (377) (15,700) cos 377t
= ---0.059 cos 377t (volts) (34)

The maximum attained by 8 is 59 millivolts. The minus sign will
ensure that Lenz's law is respected, if we have defined our directions

consistently. The variation of both (I) and 8 with time is shown in
Fig. 7.17.

What about the electric field itself? Usually we cannot deduce
E from a knowledge of curl E alone. However, our path C is here a
circle around the center of a symmetrical system. If there are no
other electric fields around, we may assume that on the circle C, E lies
in that plane and has a constant magnitude. Then it is a trivial

matter to predict its magnitude, since ICE - ds = 2-rrrE = 8, which

we have already calculated. In this case, the electric field on the
circle might look like Fig. 7.18a at a particular instant. But if there
are other field sources it could look quite different. If there happened
to be a positive and a negative charge located on the axis as shown
in Fig. 7.l8b, the electric field in the vicinity of the circle would be
the superposition of the electrostatic field of the two charges and the
induced electric field.

7.6 Mutual Inductance

Two circuits, or loops, C1 and C2 are fixed in position relative to
one another (Fig. 7.19). By some means, such as a battery and
a Variable resistance, a controllable current 11 is caused to flow in
circuit C1. Let B1(:x,y,z) be the magnetic field that would exist if
the current in C1 remained constant at the value I1, and let 4321 denote
the flux of B1 through the circuit C2. Thus,

Q21 = S2B'da2 

where S2 is a surface spanning the loop C2. With the shape and

relative position of the two circuits fixed, (1321 will be proportional
to I1;

: = const (36)

Suppose now that I1 changes with time, but slowly enough so that
the field B1 at any point in the vicinity of C2 and the current I1 in C1
at the same instant of time are related as they would be for steady
currents. (To see why such a restriction is necessary, imagine that C1
and C2 are 10 meters apart and we cause the current in C1 to double in
value in 10 nanoseconds!) The flux 4321 will change in proportion

as 11 changes. There will be an electromotive force induced in
circuit C2, of magnitude

const ffl
c dt

321: -

(37)

% p. 247
The constant here is the same as the one in Eq. 36. Let's absorb the

c in the denominator into a single constant, denoted by M21, and write
Eq. 37 in this way:

821 = -M21% (38)

We call the constant M21 the coefficient of mutual inductance. Its
value is determined by the geometry of our arrangement of loops.
The units will of course depend on our choice of units for 8, I, and t.
In the practical system, with 821 in volts and 11 in amperes, M is expressed
in henrys.T That is, the mutual inductance M21 is one henry
if a current 11 changing at the rate of 1 ampere / sec induces an electromotive
force of 1 volt in circuit C2.

As an example, consider the circuits in Fig. 7.20, two coplanar,
concentric rings, a small ring C2 and a much larger ring C1. What
is M21 in this case? At the center of C1, with I1 flowing, the field B1
is given by

_ 27711
- CR1

B1 (39)

with 11 in esu/sec, B1 in gauss. (Review the paragraph at the beginning
of Sec. 6.5, leading to Eq. 6.42, if you don't remember how to
find the field at the center of a current ring.) We assume R2 < R1
so that we can neglect the variation of B1 over the interior of the small
ring. Then the flux through the small ring is

2 1 2 21R 2
(D21 = (11322) 071;: = %_ (40)

Thus the ``constant'' in Eq. 36, in this particular case, has the value
2vr2R22/cR1, and the electromotive force induced in C2 will be

8 _ _i_ 21121122 .dI1
21 _ c CR1 dt

(41)

TThe unit is named after Joseph Henry (1797-1878), the foremost American physicist
of his time. Electromagnetic induction was discovered independently by Henry, practically
at the same time as Faraday's experiments. Henry was the first to recognize the
phenomenon of self-induction. He developed the electromagnet and the prototype of
the electric motor, invented the electric relay, and all but invented telegraphy.

 

% p. 248
with 821 in statvolts and 11 in esu per second. To express the mutual
inductance in henrys, we note that a statvolt is 300 volts and
I(esu/sec) = I(amp) x 3 X 109, so that

ZWZRZZ >< 1O'9ff (amp/sec) (42)

8(volts) = _ R1 dt

Thus the value of M21 in henrys, with R2 and R1 in centimeters, is

M,,, Z My (43)
1

Incidentally, the minus sign we had been carrying along doesn't tell
us much at this stage. If you want to be sure which way the electromotive
force will tend to drive current in C2, Lenz's law is your most
reliable guide.

If the circuit C1 consisted of N1 turns of wire instead of a single
ring, the field B1 at the center would be N1 times as strong, for a given
current I1. Also, if the small loop C2 consisted of N2 turns, all of the
same radius R2, the electromotive force in each turn would add to
that in the next, making the total electromotive force in that circuit
N2 times that of a single turn. Thus for multiple turns in each coil
the mutual inductance will be given by

2772 X l0-9N1N2R22

M :
21 R1

(44)

This assumes that the turns in each coil are neatly bundled to-
gether, the cross section of the bundle being small compared to the
coil radius. However, the mutual inductance M21 has a well-defined
meaning for two circuits of any shape or distribution. It is the ratio
of the electromotive force in volts in circuit 2, caused by changing

current in circuit 1, to the rate of change of current 11 in amperes / sec.
That is,

M21(henrys) = dl amp

% p. 249
7.7 A ``Reciprocity'' Theorem

In considering the circuits C1 and C2 we might have inquired about
the electromotive force induced in circuit C1 by a changing current
in circuit C2. That would involve another coefficient of mutual

inductance. M12:
M2 = 8" (46)

It is a remarkable fact that for any two circuits,
M12 = M21 (47)

This is not a matter of geometrical symmetry. Even the simple
example in Fig. 7.20 is not symmetrical with respect to the two
circuits. Note that R1 and R2 enter in different ways into the expression
for M21; Eq. 47 asserts that. for these two dissimilar circuits, if
 then M,, = 

R1 R1
also---and not what we would get by switching l's and 2's everywhere!

To prove the theorem, Eq. 47, we have to show that the flux (1)12
through some circuit C1 as a result of a current I in a circuit C2 is
equal to the flux CD21 that threads circuit 2 when an equal current I
flows in circuit C1. To show this, we use the vector potential.

According to Stokes' theorem:

M21 :

LA-ds =fS(cur1 A) -da (48)

In particular, if A is the vector potential of a magnetic field B, that is,
if B = curl A, then we have

<4"

That is, the line integral of the vector potential around a loop is equal
to the flux of B through the loop.
Now the vector potential is related to its current source as follows,

according to Eq. 6.35:

A21 = L E (50)

6 C1 T21

A21 is the vector potential, at some point (x2,y2,z2), of the magnetic
field caused by current I (esu/sec) flowing in circuit C1; ds1 is an

% p. 250
element of the loop C1; and r21 is the magnitude of the distance from
that element to the point (x2,y2,z2).
Figure 7.21 shows the two loops C1 and C2, with current I flowing

in C1. Let (x2,y2,z2) be a point on the loop C2. Then the flux
through C2 due to current I in C1 is:

I I ds
(I321 :L2A21 ' ds2 :1;/12 dS2 ' A21 = FJQJZIIS2 ' 01?: (51)

Similarly, the flux through C1 due to current I flowing in C2 would
be given by

1 d
(1)12 = : folds, g (52)

C2 T12

Now r12 = r21, for these are just distance magnitudes, not vectors.
The meaning of each of the integrals above is: Take the scalar product
of a pair of line elements, one on each loop, divide by the distance
between them and sum over all pairs. The only difference between
Eq. 51 and Eq. 52 is the order in which this operation is carried out,
and that cannot affect the final sum. Hence (1312 = (1921, from which
it follows directly that M12 = M21. Thanks to this theorem, we need
make no distinction between M12 and M21. We may speak, hence-
forth, of the mutual inductance M of any two circuits.

Theorems of this sort are often called ``reciprocity'' theorems.
There are some other reciprocity theorems on electrical circuits, not
unrelated to this one. This may remind you of the relation C,-k = Ck,-
mentioned in Sec. 3.6 and treated in Prob. 3.27. A reciprocity relation
usually expresses some general symmetry law which is not apparent
in the superficial structure of the system. You will meet an
extremely sweeping, and from some points of view surprising,

reciprocity law when you study the transmission of electromagnetic
waves.

7.8 Self-inductance
When the current I1 is changing, there is a change in the flux
through circuit C1 itself, consequently an electromotive force is in-

duced. Call this 811. The induction law holds, whatever the source
of the flux:

an 2 _ L d'1>u

cdt

(53)

% p. 251
where (1311 is the flux through circuit 1 of the field B1 due to the current
I 1 in circuit 1. The minus sign expresses the fact that the electromotive
force is always directed so as to oppose the change in current---
Lenz's law, again. Since <I>11 will be proportional to I1 we can write

811 = -L1 % (54)
The constant L1 is called the self-inductance of the circuit.

As an example of a circuit for which L1 can be calculated, consider
the rectangular toroidal coil of Prob. 6.19, shown here again in
Fig. 7.22. You found (if you worked that problem) that a current I,
in esu/sec, flowing in the coil of N turns produces a field the strength
of which, at a radius r from the axis of the coil, is given by B = 2N1/er.
The total flux through one turn of the coil is the integral of this field
over the cross section of the coil:

<1>(one turn) 2 h b2NI dr = 2NIh ln  (55)
a or c a
The flux threading the circuit of N turns is N times as great:
«D = 2N2"' ln (2) (56)
c a
Hence the induced electromotive force 8 is
_ 1 dd) _ 2N?h ) dI
8-7?-' C2 1" am (57)
Thus the self-inductance of this coil is given by
L = 2N2" ln (9) (58)
c2 (1

Equation 58 is the correct expression for the inductance if I is measured
in esu/sec and 8 in statvolts. For I in amperes and 8 in volts
the appropriate unit for L is the henry, as in the case of mutual in-
ductance. Converting to these units we get:

L (henrys) = 2 x 10-9N2h1n (59)

You may think that one of the rings we considered earlier would
have made a simpler example to illustrate the calculation of self-
inductance. However, if we try to calculate the inductance of a
simple circular loop of wire, we encounter a puzzling difficulty. It

 

 

% p. 252
seems a good idea to simplify the problem by assuming that the wire
has zero diameter. But we soon discover that if finite current flows
in a filament of zero diameter, the flux threading a loop made of such
a filament is infinite! The reason is that the field B, in the neighborhood
of a filamentary current, varies as 1/r where r is the distance
from the filament, and the integral of B'x area diverges as f(dr/r)
when we extend it down to r = 0. To avoid this we may let the radius
of the wire be finite, not zero, which is more realistic anyway. This
may make the calculation a bit more complicated, in a given case,
but that won't worry us. The real difficulty is that different parts of
the wire now appear as different circuits, linked by different amounts
of flux. We are no longer sure what we mean by the flux through the
circuit. In fact, because the electromotive force is different in the
different filamentary loops into which the circuit can be divided. some
redistribution of current density must occur when rapidly changing
currents flow in the ring. Hence the inductance of the circuit may
depend somewhat on the rapidity of change of I, and thus not be
strictly a constant as Eq. 54 would imply.

We avoided this embarrassment in the toroidal coil example by
ignoring the field in the immediate vicinity of the individual turns of
the winding. Most of the flux does not pass through the wires themselves
and whenever that is the case the effect we have just been
worrying about will be unimportant.

7.9 A Circuit Containing Self-inductance

Suppose we connect a battery, providing electromotive force 80,
to a coil, or inductor, with self-inductance L, as in Fig. 7.230. The
coil itself, the connecting wires, and even the battery will have some
resistance. We don't care how this is distributed around the circuit.
It can all be lumped together in one resistance R, indicated on the
circuit diagram of Fig. 7.23b by a resistor symbol with this value.
Also, the rest of the circuit, especially the connecting wires, contribute
a bit to the self-inductance of the whole circuit; we assume that
this is included in L. In other words, Fig. 7.23b represents an
idealization of the physical circuit: the inductor L, symbolized by
\.U.Qr, has no resistance; the resistor R has no inductance. It is
this idealized circuit that we shall now analyze. F

If the current I in the circuit is changing at the rate dI/dt. an electromotive
force L dI/dt will be induced, in a direction to oppose the
change. Also, there is the constant electromotive force 80 of the

% p. 253
(Jhap. 7 Electromagnetic Induction 253

battery. If we define the positive current direction as the one in
which the battery tends to drive current around the circuit, then the
net electromotive force at any instant is 80 - L dI/dt. This drives
the current I through the resistor R. That is,

so - L% = R1 (60)

We can also describe the situation in this way: The potential difference
between points A and B, which we'll call the voltage across
the inductor, is L dI/dt, with the upper end of the inductor positive
if I in the direction shown is increasing. The potential difference
between B and C, the voltage across the resistor, is RI, with the upper
end of the resistor positive. Hence the sum of the voltage across the
inductor and the voltage across the resistor is L dI/dt + RI. This is
the same as the potential difference between the battery terminals,

which is 80 (our idealized battery has no internal resistance). Thus
we have

_ ff 1
80_Ldt+RI (6)

which is merely a restatement of Eq. 60.

Before we look at the mathematical solution of Eq. 60, 1et's predict
what ought to happen in this circuit if the switch is closed at t = 0.
Before the switch is closed, I = 0, necessarily. A long time after the
switch has been closed, some steady state will have been attained,
with current practically constant at some value 10. Then and there-
after, dI/dt 2: O, and Eq. 60 reduces to

80 : R10 (62)

The transition from zero current to the steady-state current I0 cannot
occur abruptly at t = 0, for then dI/dt would be infinite. In fact,
just after t = 0, the current I will be so small that the second term
R1 in Eq. 60 can be ignored, giving

dI _ 80
E - L (63)
The inductance L limits the rate of rise of the current.
What we now know is summarized in Fig. 7.24a. It only remains

to find how the whole change takes place. Equation 60 is a differ-

% p. 254
nu: LJVI/I/Ulklllvtffglffl/VWU anvwwuuwurw

Vol. 1, Chap. 6. Without further ado we can write down a solution
to Eq. 60 which satisfies our initial condition, I = O at t = O.

50 _
I 2 _ 1 _ (R/L)t 64
R( e > < >

The graph in Fig. 7.241) shows the current approaching its asymptotic
value 10 exponentially. The ``time constant'' of this circuit is
the quantity L/R. If L is measured in henrys and R in ohms, this
comes out in seconds, since henrys ~ vo1ts/ (amp/sec), and
ohms ~ volts/amperes.

What happens if we open the switch after the current I0 has been
established, thus forcing the current to drop abruptly to zero? That
would make the term L dI/dt negatively infinite! The catastrophe
can be more than mathematical. People have been killed opening
switches in highly inductive circuits. What happens generally is that
a very high induced voltage causes a spark or are across the open
switch contacts, so that the current continues after all. Let us instead
remove the battery from the circuit by closing a conducting
path across the LR combination, as in Fig. 7.250. at the same time dis-

connecting the battery. We now have a circuit described by the
equation

0=L%+H1 (65)

with the initial condition I = 10 at t = t1, where t1 is the instant at
which the short circuit was closed. The solution is the simple exponential
decay function:

1 = I06-(R/L)(t-t1) (66)

with the same characteristic time, L/R, as before.

7.10 Energy Stored in the Magnetic Field
During the decay of the current described by Eq. 66 and Fig. 7.2511,
energy is dissipated in the resistor R. Since the energy d U dissipated

in any short interval dt is R12 dt, the total energy dissipated after
the closing of the switch at time t1 must be:

U = °°R12 dt = °°RI02e~<2R/L><t-m dt (67)

% p. 255
With the substitution x = 2B(t - t1)/L this is easily evaluated:

U = R102 f0°°e-I dx = iuoz (68)

The source of this energy was the inductor with its magnetic field.
Indeed, exactly that amount of work had been done by the battery
to build up the current in the first place---over and above the energy
dissipated in the resistor between t = 0 and t = t1, which was also
provided by the battery. To see that this is a general relation, note
that if we have an increasing current in an inductor, work must be
done to drive the current I against the induced electromotive force
L (II/dt. So in time dt the work done is

ff

dW: LI dt

dt = LI dI =iLd(12) (69)

Therefore, we may assign a total energy
U = §LI2 (70)

to an inductor carrying current I. With the eventual decay of this
current, that amount of energy will appear somewhere else.

It is natural to regard this as energy stored in the magnetic field
of the inductor, just as we have described the energy of a charged
capacitor as stored in its electric field. The energy of a capacitor
charged to potential difference V is §CV2, and is accounted for by
assigning to an element of volume do, where the electric field strength
is E, an amount of energy (1/87r)E2 do. It is pleasant, but hardly
surprising, to find that an exactly similar relation holds for the energy
stored in an inductor. That is, we can ascribe to the magnetic field
an energy density (1/87r)B2, and summing the energy of the whole
field will give the energy §LI2.

To show how this works out in one case, we can go back to the
toroidal coil whose inductance L we calculated in Sec. 7.8. We
found (Eq. 58)

L = 2W' In (E) (71)

The magnetic field strength B, with current I flowing, was given

(72)

% p. 256
To calculate the volume integral of B2/8w we can use a volume element
consisting of the cylindrical shell sketched in Fig. 7.26, with
volume Zvrrh dr. As this shell expands from r = a to r = b, it sweeps
through all the space that contains magnetic field. (The field B is
zero everywhere outside the torus, remember.)

WfB2dv:87  Cr ) 27rrhdr: C2 ln(;) (73)

Comparing this result with Eq. 71, we see that, indeed,

1
8---WfB2 do = %LI2 (74)

The more general statement, the counterpart of our statement for
the electric field in Eq. 1.36, is that the energy U to be associated with
any magnetic field B(x,y,z) is given by:

(75)

 

With B in gauss and v in cubic centimeters, U in Eq. 75 will be given
in ergs. In Eq. 70, we may use practical units, henrys and amperes,
for L and I, and then U will be given in joules.

7.11 ``Something is Missing''

Let us review the relations between charges and fields. As we
learned in Chap. 2, a statement equivalent to Coulomb's law is the
differential relation

div E = 4'n'p (76)

connecting the electric charge density p and the electric field E. This
holds for moving charges as well as stationary charges. That is, p can
be a function of time as well as position. As we emphasized in
Chap. 5, the fact that Eq. 76 holds for moving charges is consistent
with charge invariance: No matter how an isolated charged particle
may be moving, its charge, as measured by the integral of E over a
surface surrounding it, appears the same in every frame of reference.

% p. 257
Electric charge in motion is electric current. Because charge is
never created or destroyed, the charge density p and the current
density J always satisfy the condition

divJ= _@ (77)

We first wrote down this ``Equation of Continuity'' as Eq. 4.9.
If the current density J is constant in time, we call it a stationary

current distribution. The magnetic field of a stationary current distribution
satisfies the equation

curl B = 4T'"J (78)

We worked with this relation in Chap. 6.

Now we are interested in charge distributions and fields that are
changing in time. Suppose we have a charge distribution p(x,y,z,t)
with Bp/at sé 0. For instance, we might have a capacitor which is

discharging through a resistor. According to Eq. 77, ap/at7&O
implies

div J yé O (79)

But according to Eq. 78, since the divergence of the curl of any
vector function is identically zero (see Prob. 2.15),

div J = L div (curl B) = 0 (80)
477'

The contradiction shows that Eq. 78 cannot be correct for a system
in which the charge density is varying in time. Of course, no one
claimed it was; a stationary current distribution, for which Eq. (78)
does hold, is one in which not even the current density J, let alone the

charge density p, is time-dependent.
The problem can be posed in somewhat different terms by considering
the line integral of magnetic field around the wire carrying

charge away from the capacitor plate in Fig. 7.27. According to
Stokes' theorem,

fen-d1=Lcur1B-da (81)

The surface S passes right through the conductor in which a current
I is flowing. Inside this conductor, curl B has a finite value,
namely 47rJ/0, and the integral on the right comes out equal to 4771/c.
That is to say, if the curve C is close to the wire and well away from
the capacitor gap, the magnetic field there is not different from the

% p. 258
field around any wire carrying the same current. Now the surface S'
in Fig. 7.28 is also a surface spanning C, and has an equally good
claim to be used in the statement of Stokes' theorem, Eq. 81.
Through this surface, however, there flows no current at all! Never-
theless, curl B cannot be zero over all of S' without violating Stokes'
theorem. Therefore, on S', curl B must depend on something other
than the current density J.

We can only conclude that Eq. 78 has to be replaced by some

other relation, in the more general situation of changing charge dis-
tributions. Let's write instead

curl B = 47% + ('2) (82)

and see if we can discover what ('?) must be.

Another line of thought suggests the answer. Remember that the
transformation laws of the electromagnetic field, Eq. 6.58, are quite
symmetrical in E and B. Now in Faraday's induction phenomenon
a changing magnetic field is accompanied by an electric field, in a
manner described by our Eq. 30:

curl E = _ ii (30)

cat

% p. 259
This is a local relation connecting the electric and magnetic fields in
empty space-charges are not directly involved. If symmetry with
respect to E and B is to prevail, we must expect that a changing electric
field can give rise to a magnetic field. There ought to be an induction
phenomenon described by an equation like Eq. 30, but with
the roles of E and B switched. It will turn out that we need to change
the sign too, but that is all:

curl B = :7} (83)

This provides the missing term that is called for in Eq. 82. To
try it out, write

cui1B=4T"J+%-%% (84)
and take the divergence of both sides:
div (curl B) = div (EJ) + div (LE) (85)
c c at

The left side is necessarily zero, as already remarked. In the second
term on the right we can interchange the order of differentiation with
respect to space coordinates and time. Thus

.1aE_ia. _477Bp
'""(:7) - cw""VE) 'T73? (86)

by Eq. 76. The right-hand side of Eq. 85 now becomes
- div J + --- (87)

which is zero by virtue of the continuity condition, Eq. 77.

The new term resolves the difficulty raised in Fig. 7.28. As charge
flows out of the capacitor, the electric field, which at any instant has
the configuration in Fig. 7.29, diminishes in intensity. In this case,

1 BE

BE/at points opposite to E. The vector function F E is represented
by the black arrows in Fig. 7.30. With curl B = 4T7TJ + %-aa%, the

integral of curl B over S' now has the same value as it does over S.
On 8' the second term contributes everything; on S the first term, the
term with J, is practically all that counts.

7.12 The Displacement Current

Observe that the vector field L 381;; appears to form a continuation

c

of the conduction current distribution. Maxwell called it the displacement
current, and the name has stuck although it no longer
seems very appropriate. To be precise, we can define a ``displace-
ment current density" J,,,, to be distinguished from the conduction
current density J, by writing Eq. 84 this way:

curl B = 4_:(J + Jd) (88)
and defining J,,, E 

We needed the new term to make the relation between current and
magnetic field consistent with the continuity equation, in the case
of conduction currents changing in time. If it belongs there, it
implies the existence of a new induction effect in which a changing
electric field is accompanied by a magnetic field. If the eff'ect is real,
why didn't Faraday discover it? For one thing, he wasn't looking
for it, but there is a more fundamental reason why experiments like
F araday's could not have revealed any new effects attributable to the
last term in Eq. 84. In any apparatus in which there are changing
electric fields, there are present at the same time conduction currents,
charges in motion. The magnetic field B, everywhere around the
apparatus, is just about what you would expect those conduction
currents to produce. In fact, it is almost exactly the field you would
calculate if, ignoring the fact that the circuits may not be continuous,
you used the ``Biot-Savart'' formula, Eq. 6.38, to find the contribution
of each conduction current element to the field at some point in space.

Consider, for example, the point P in the space between our discharging
condenser plates, Fig. 7.31. Each element of conduction
current, in the wires and on the surface of the plates, contributes to
the field at P, according to the Biot-Savart formula. Must We include
also the elements of ``displacement current'' Jd? The answer is rather
surprising. We may include Jd; but if we are careful to include the
entire displacement current distribution, its net effect will be zero for
relatively slowly varying fields.

To see why this is so, notice that the vector function J,,;, indicated
by the black arrows in Fig. 7.30, has the same form as the electric
field E in Fig. 7.29. This electric field is practically an electrostatic
field, except that it is slowly dying away. We expect therefore that
its curl is practically zero which would imply that curl J must be

% p. 262
practically zero. More precisely, we have curl E = - L311 and

cat

with the displacement current Jd = Li, we get, by interchang-

47r at
ing the order of differentiation,

curl J,,, = 4L7Tcur1  = 4-£T-5a;(curl E) = -  (89)
This will be negligible for sulficiently slow changes in field. We
may call a slowly changing field quasi-static. Now if Jd is a vector
field without any curl, it can be made up, in the same way that the
electrostatic field can be made of the fields of point charges, by superposing
radial currents flowing outward from point sources or in
toward point ``sinks'' (Fig. 7.32). But the magnetic field of any
radial, symmetrical current distribution, calculated (1 la Biot-Savart,

must be zero by symmetry, for there is no unique direction anywhere,
except the radial direction itself.

In the quasi-static field, then, the conduction currents alone are
the only sources needed to account for the magnetic field. In other
words, if Faraday had arranged something like Fig. 7.31, and had
been able to measure the magnetic field at P, by using a compass
needle say, he would not have been surprised. He would not have
needed to invent a displacement current to explain it.

% p. 263
To see this new induction efi'ect, we need rapidly changing fields.
In fact, we need changes to occur in the time it takes light to cross
the apparatus. That is why the direct demonstration had to wait for

Hertz, whose experiment came many years after the law itself had
been worked out by Maxwell.

7.13 Maxwell's Equations

James Clerk Maxwell, after immersing himself in the accounts of
Faraday's electrical researches, set out to formulate mathematically
a theory of electricity and magnetism. Maxwell could not exploit
re1ativity---that came fifty years later. The electrical constitution
of matter was a mystery, the relation between light and electromagnetism
unsuspected. Many of the arguments that we have used to
make our next step seem obvious were unthinkable then. Neverthe-
less, as Maxwell's theory developed, the term we have been discuss-
ing, 6E/at, appeared quite naturally in his formulation. He called
it the ``displacement current.'' Maxwell was concerned with electric
fields in solid matter as well as in vacuum, and when he talks about
a ``displacement current'' he is often including some charge-in-
motion, too. We'll clarify that point in Chap. 9 when we study electric
fields in matter. Indeed, Maxwell thought of space itself as a
medium, the ``aether,'' so that even in the absence of solid matter the
displacement current was occurring in something. But never mind---
his mathematical equations were perfectly clear and unambiguous,
and his introduction of the displacement current was a theoretical
discovery of the first rank. '

Maxwell's description of the electromagnetic field was essentially
complete. We have arrived by different routes at various pieces of it,
which we shall now assemble in the form traditionally called
Maxwell 's equations:

(90)

 

These are written for the fields in vacuum, in the presence of electric

charge of density p and electric current, that is, charge-in-motion,
of density J.

in

% p. 264
The first equation is Faraday's law of induction. The second
expresses the dependence of the magnetic field on the displacement
current density, or rate-of-change of electric field, and on the conduction
current density, or rate-of-motion of charge. The third
equation is equivalent to Coulomb's law. The fourth equation states
that there are no sources of magnetic field except currents. We shall
have more to say about this aspect of Nature in Chap. 10.

Notice that the lack of symmetry in these equations, with respect
to B and E, is entirely due to the presence of electric charge and elec-

tric conduction current. In empty space, the terms with p and J are
zero, and Maxwell's equations become

(91)

 

Here the displacement current term is all-important. Its presence,
along with its counterpart in the first equation, implies the possibility
of electromagnetic waves. Recognizing that, Maxwell went on to
develop with brilliant success an electromagnetic theory of light.
You will be exploring the physics of waves, and of light waves in
particular, in Vol. III. We can show right now that an electromagnetic
disturbance traveling at speed c is compatible with Maxwell's
equations. To do this, we shall describe a very simple set of electric
and magnetic fields which represent a traveling disturbance, and
then we shall show that these fields satisfy all the equations in the
box, Eqs. 91.

At the instant of time t = 0, there exists, we suppose, an electric
field in the region between the planes y = 0 and y = 2a. This field E

has a z component only, and its z component depends only on y, in
the following manner:

Ez=E0% <o:y:a>
(at time t = 0) (92)

2 - _ _
Ee=EO( "Q 9) (a2y22a>
As indicated in Fig. 7.33a, this describes a ``gable''-shaped distribution
of field strength, maximum in the center at y = a and falling off
linearly to zero at y = a and g = 2a. For given y, the field is the
same at all x and z. That is, we have electric field throughout an

% p. 265
% p. 266
infinite slab, although in the figure we show field vectors on the y axis
only. The shaded patches marked I and II lie within this slab.
Everywhere outside the slab, that is, for y < O and y > 2a, the electric
field is zero at this instant of time. At the same time a magnetic
field B exists in this slab of space. It has an x component only.
given by:

Bz=B0% (05y§a)
(at time t = O) (93)

B,=Bo(2"a"') <a:y:2a>

We simply invented this field. Let us now command the field
configuration to travel in the y direction with speed 0, while preserving
its shape. We can do that by writing out orders as follows:

Region 1:
E2 = E0 (y - ct)
Cl _ _
_ Ct (ct 2 y 2 at + a) (94)
B' : B0 (y a )
Region II:
2 _
E, : E0  _ _
20- +Ct (ct+a2y2ct+2a) (95)
Bx = Bo <+)

This describes the situation as we see it in Fig. 7.3312, or at any other
time t. The region containing field is simply displaced to the right
by a distance at. Within regions I and II, both E and B have the same
form as before. Our equations, then, describe a traveling configuration
of electric and magnetic fields, but can such fields exist? To
answer that, we must see if E and B, as given by Eqs. 94 and 95, satisfy
Maxwell's equations.

Beginning with the divergence equations, it is easy to see that
div E = 0 and div B = 0. (Obviously 6E,/Bz = O and the other
components of E are themselves zero.) But curl E is not zero.
Instead, its value is:

In Region I: V x E _-_ ii = f;

(96)
In Region II: V x E = $2 = -

% p. 267
In the same way we calculate V x B:

In Regionlz VxB= -i aaB' = -%i

The partial derivatives with respect to t are:

(98)
In Region II: % : %E0i % : %Box

The fields will satisfy the "induction" equations in region I, then, if

E , 1 ,
7°' = ':('§B°")
and B I C (99)
__°2 =_(_ -1202)
a C a

Indeed, these are satisfied provided E0 = B0. The equations lead
to exactly the same requirement for the fields in region II. Exactly
at the peak of the gable, and also at each end, there are mathematical
singularities in the assumed fields. To be sure that the field equations
are satisfied everywhere, we must see that there is no trouble at these
points. There is none, because E and B are continuous there. (An
abrupt jump. or discontinuity, in E or B would not be possible in
empty space.) Thus the particular electromagnetic field we have
described. which does represent a traveling wave, does satisfy all the
field equations, if the electric field, in statvolts/cm, is everywhere
equal to the magnetic field strength, at the same time and place. It is
essential that E and B be perpendicular to one another and to the
direction of travel---otherwise the field equation could not have been
satisfied.

Our traveling ``gable'' may strike you as a rather special kind of
wave. In fact, this simple example reveals all that is essential about
any plane electromagnetic wave! We need only think of super-
position. As we have frequently emphasized, the equations of the
electromagnetic field are linear. If two sets of fields satisfy Maxwell's
equations, so does their sum. We can have any number of our
``gable'' fields traveling through space, in the same or different direc-
tions. (Naturally, the fields don't care how the axes are oriented-

% p. 268
any other direction is as good as the y axis.) Fig. 7.34 suggests some
of the waves you could make with ``gables.'' It is pretty obvious that
any function could be approximated as closely as desired by superposing
``gables.'' Therefore, what we have learned about the gable
wave must apply to any wave in which E and B are functions only
of the coordinate in the direction of travel. These general facts are:

(i) The disturbance travels with speed c, with unchanging
form. \

(ii) E and B are perpendicular to each other and to the direction
of travel, with the vector E x B always pointing in the
direction of the travel, as it does in our example.

(iii) At a given point and time, E = B.

An electromagnetic field with these properties transforms in a
simple and satisfying way when we change coordinate systems. In
Chap. 6 we derived formulas for the Lorentz transformation of the
electric and magnetic fields (Eq. 6.58). Let's use the results of
Prob. 6.11, which were based on those equations, according to which
the two scalar quantities, E2 - B2 and E - B remain invariant in a
transformation to another inertial frame. In this case, since E = B
at any point, the invariant quantity E2 - B2 has the value zero. Also.
because E is perpendicular to B, the other invariant E - B is zero. It
follows that in any other frame the transformed fields E' and B' must
be equal to each other in magnitude and perpendicular in direction.
A light wave looks like a light wave in any frame of reference.

a general conclusion, valid for any conceivable pair of coils, concerning the

to be generally of the order of magnitude of 10*" gauss. The matter in this
space is typically nothing much but hydrogen atoms, about one per cubic centi-

can in principle be calculated by summing the contributions from all elements
of conduction current, as indicated in Fig. 7.31. That might be a long job. If

we can assume symmetry about this axis, it is very much easier to find the
field B at a point by using the integral law

Chapter 8 Alternating-current Circuits

8.1 A Resonant Circuit

A circuit containing inductance, capacitance, and resistance was
one of the examples of the damped harmonic oscillator discussed in
Vol. 1, Chap. 7. Now we can see exactly what goes on in that system.
The circuit diagram in Fig. 8.1 represents such a ``series RLC '' circuit.

Let Q be the charge, at time t, on the capacitor in this circuit. The
potential difference, or voltage across the capacitor, is V, which
obviously is the same as the voltage across the series combination
of inductor L and resistor R. We take V to be positive when the upper
capacitor plate is positively charged, and we define the positive current
direction by the arrow in Fig. 8.1. With the signs chosen that

way, the relations connecting charge Q, current I, and voltage across
the capacitor V are:

d d
I=---Q- Q=CV V=L7:+R1 (1)

We want to eliminate two of the three variables Q, I, and V. From

 

the first two equations we obtain I = - C dV/dt, and the third equation
becomes V = -LC(d2V/dt2) - RC(dV/dt), or

d2V R dV 1 _

dt2 + (f)E+ (f€)V'O (2)

This is a second-order differential equation with constant coef-
ficients. We shall try a solution of the form

V = Ae'"' cos wt (3)

where A, or, and w are constants. The first and second derivatives of
this function are:

'fT't] = Ae'"'[ -a cos wt - no sin wt] (4)
dzv : Ae'"'[(a2 - <02) COS out + Zaw sin wt] (5)

dt2

% p. 275
Substituting back into Eq. 2, we cancel out the common factor Ae"a'
and are left with

(oz? - 0:2) cos wt + Zaw sin wt - %(oz COS wt + to sin wt)

1 _
+Ecoswt_0 (6)

This will be satisfied for all t if, and only if, the coefficients of sin wt
and cos out are both zero. That is, we must require:

2aw-T=O (7)
and
a2-o.>2-¢x%-+%=0 (8)

The first of these equations gives a condition on a:

__R_
"' 2L (9)

while the second equation requires that:

w2:%6~-¢x%-+a2=-L%-% (10)
Since our constant on is a real number, to? cannot be negative.
Therefore we succeed in obtaining a solution of the form assumed in
Eq. 3 only if R2/4L2 § 1/LC. In fact it is the case of ``light
damping,'' that is, low resistance, that we want to examine, so we
shall assume that the values of R, L, and C in the circuit are such that
the inequality R < 2x/L/C holds.
The function Ae'"' cos out is not the only possible solution.
Bra' sin wt works just as well, with the same requirements, Eq. 9 and

Eq. 10, on at and 4» respectively. The general solution is the sum of
these:

V(t) = e'"'(A cos wt + B sin wt) (11)

The arbitrary constants A and B could be adjusted to fit initial
conditions. That is not very interesting. Whether the solution in
any given case involves the sine or the cosine function, or some super-
position, is a trivial matter of how the clock is set. The essential
phenomenon is a damped sinusoidal oscillation.

% p. 276
The variation of voltage with time is shown in Fig. 8.2a. Of course,
this cannot really hold for all past time. At some time in the past
the circuit must have been provided with energy somehow, and then
left running. For instance, the capacitor might have been charged,
with the circuit open, and then connected to the coil.

In Fig. 8.2b the time scale has been expanded and the dotted curve
showing the variation of the current I has been added. For Vlet us
take the damped cosine, Eq. 3. Then the current as a function of time
is given by:

1: _ cd_V=ACw (sin wt+£coswt)e-at (12)
dt on

The ratio 01/00 is a measure of the damping. If 01/ to is very small,
many oscillations occur while the amplitude is decaying only a little.
For Fig. 8.2 we chose a case in which at/w : 0.04. Then the cosine
term in Eq. 12 doesn't amount to much. All it does, in effect, is shift
the phase by a small angle, tan'1 (Oi/0.)). So the current oscillation

is almost exactly one-quarter cycle out of phase with the voltage
oscillation.

The oscillation involves a transfer of energy back and forth from
the capacitor to the inductor, or from electric field to magnetic field.
At the times marked 1 in Fig. 8.217 all the energy is in the electric field.
A quarter-cycle later, at 2, the capacitor is discharged and nearly all
this energy is found in the magnetic field of the coil. Meanwhile, the
circuit resistance R is taking its toll, and as the oscillation goes on,
the energy remaining in the fields gradually diminishes.

The relative damping in an oscillator is often expressed by giving a
number called Q. This was introduced in the general discussion of
harmonic oscillators in Vol. 1, Chap. 7. Q (not to be confused with
the charge on the capacitor!) is said to stand for ``quality'' or ``quality
factor.'' In fact, no one calls it that; we just call it ``Q.'' The less
the damping, the larger the number Q. For an oscillator with frequency
co, Q is the dimensionless ratio formed as follows:

energy stored

Q : w average power dissipated

(13)

Or you may prefer to remember that Q is the number of radians of
the argument wt (that is, 277 times the number of cycles) required for
the energy in the oscillator to diminish by the factor l/e.

% p. 277
% p. 278
In our circuit the stored energy is proportional to V2 or I2 and,
therefore, to e'2°<'. The energy decays by l/e in a time t = l/2a,
which covers oo/2a radians. Hence for our RLC circuit

Q=2ia=% (14)

As a rough estimate, what is the Q of the oscillation represented in
Fig. 8.2?

Clearly, the general case we have just studied includes some simple
special cases. If R = O we have the completely undamped oscillator,
whose frequency we is given by

0.10 =L (15)

\/T
Mostly we deal with systems in which the damping is small enough
to be ignored in calculating the frequency. As Prob. 8.9 will demon-
strate, damping has only a second-order effect on m.

For completeness we review brieffy what goes on in the over-
damped circuit, in which R > 2\/L/ C. Equation 2 then has a solution
of the form V = Ae'/" for two values of B, the general solution
being

V(t) = Ae'l31' + Be'/32' (16)

There are no oscillations, only a monotonic decay. In the special

case of ``critical'' damping, R = 2\/L/ C, 31 = B2 and the solution
of the differential equation, Eq. 2, takes the form

V(t) = (A + Bt)e'/3' (17)

This is the condition, for given L and C, in which the total energy
in the circuit is most rapidly dissipated. (See Prob. 8.8.)

You can see this whole range of behavior in Fig. 8.3, where V(t) is
plotted for two underdamped circuits, a critically damped circuit,
and an overdamped circuit. The capacitor and inductor remain the
same; only the resistor is changed. The natural angular frequency
we = 1/\/LC is 106 sec'1 for this circuit, corresponding to a frequency
in cycles per second of 106/277, or 159 kilocycles/sec.

The circuit is started off by charging the capacitor to a potential
difference of, say, 1 volt and then closing the switch at t = 0. That
is, V = l at t = 0 is one initial condition. Also, I = 0 at t = 0, because
the inductor will not allow the current to rise discontinuously.
Therefore, the other initial condition on V is dV/dt = 0, at t = 0.

% p. 279
Notice that all four decay curves start the same way. In the heavily
damped case (B = 600 ohms) most of the decay curve looks like
the simple exponential decay of an RC circuit. Only the very beginning
where the curve is rounded over so that it starts with zero slope,
betrays the presence of the inductance L.

8.2 Alternating Current

The resonant circuit we have just discussed contained no source
of energy and was, therefore, doomed to a transient activity, an
oscillation that must sooner or later die out. In an alternating-
current circuit we are concerned with a steady state, a current and
voltage oscillating sinusoidally without change in amplitude. Some
oscillating electromotive force drives the system.

Let us apply an electromotive force 8 = 80 cos wt to a circuit containing
inductance and resistance. We might generate 8 by a
machine schematically like the one in Fig. 7.13, having provided
some engine or motor to turn the shaft at the constant angular
speed ea. In Fig. 8.4 this electromotive force is represented as connected
into the circuit. We shall neglect any internal resistance in
the generator, or include it in R. We set the sum of potential drops
over the element of this circuit equal to the electromotive force 8,

exactly as we did in developing Eq. 7.61. The equation governing
the current is then:

Lff

dt + R1 = 80 cos wt (18)

Now there may be some transient behavior, depending on the
initial conditions, that is, on how and when the generator is switched
on. But we are interested only in the steady state, when the current
is oscillating obediently at the frequency of the driving force, with
the amplitude and phase necessary to keep Eq. 18 satisfied. To show
that this is possible, consider a current described by

I = 10 cos (wt + (p) (19)

To determine the constants I0 and $\pot$, we put this into Eq. 18:
-LI0w sin (wt + q:) - RIO cos (wt + go) = 80 cos wt (20)
The functions cos wt and sin wt can be separated out:

-LI0w(sin wt cos (p + cos wt sin (p)
+RI0(cos wt cos (p - sin wt sin (p) = 80 cos wt (21)

 

% p. 280
 
 

Setting the coefficients of cos wt and sin wt separately equal to zero,

-LI0w cos (p - RIO sin cp = 0 (22)
which gives
tan go 2 - EH14 (23)
-LI0w sin (p + R10 cosgb _ 50 = 0 (24)
which gives

or since

10 = 8° (27)

, /R2 + w2L2

In Fig. 8.5 the oscillations of 8 and I are plotted on the same graph.
Since $\pot$ is a negative angle, the current reaches its maximum a bit
later than the electromotive force. One says, ``The current lags the
voltage in an inductive circuit.'' The quantity wL which has the
dimensions of resistance and can be expressed in ohms is called the
inductive reactance.

If we replace the inductor L by a capacitor C, as in Fig. 8.6, we
have a circuit governed by the equation

- % + HI = 80 cos wt (28)

We consider the steady-state solution
I = 10 cos (wt + (p) (29)
Since I _-_ -dQ/dt, we have
Q=_f1dt=_I_°sin(wt+<p) (30)
00
Note that in going from I to Q by integration, there is no question

of adding a constant of integration, for we know that Q must oscillate
symmetrically about zero in the steady state.

% p. 281
Substituting back into Eq. 28 leads to

1_0

C sin (wt + (p) + RIO cos (cot + (p) = 80 cos wt (31)
(.0

Just as before, we obtain conditions on go and 10 by requiring that the
coelficients of cos wt and sin wt separately vanish. In this case, the
results are:

l
RwC

tan q) : 

and

10 = :8'; (33)

\/R2 + (l/wC)2

Notice that the phase angle is now positive. As the saying goes, the
current ``leads the Voltage'' in a capacitive circuit. What this means
is apparent in the graph of Fig. 8.7.

Mathematically speaking, the function

_ 80 _ OJL
I _ \/---1  cos (wt - tan 1 Y) (34)

is a particular integral of the differential equation, Eq. 18. To this
could be added a complementary function, that is, any solution of
the homogeneous differential equation

dI _
L? + RI _ 0 (35)

Now this is just Eq. 765, whose solution we found, in Sec. 7.9, to be
an exponentially decaying function,

1 ~ e-<R/L» (36)

The physical significance is this: A transient, determined by some

 

  

initial conditions, is represented by a decaying component of I (t), _

of the form of Eq. 36. After a time t > L/R, this will have vanished
leaving only the steady sinusoidal oscillation at the driving frequency,
represented by the particular integral, Eq. 34.

The similarity of our results for the RL circuit and the RC circuit
suggests a way to look at the inductor and capacitor in series.
Suppose an alternating current I = I0 cos (wt + q)) is somehow

% p. 282
 
 

caused to flow through such a combination (shown in Fig. 8.8). The
voltage across the inductor, VL, will be:

VL = L:ii-£ = -IowL sin (wt + (p) (37)

The Voltage Vg across the capacitor, with sign consistent with the sign
Of VL, lS

V0 : - % = -C-JTdt = +)Cs1n (wt + 90) (38)

The voltage across the combination is then

v=vL+vc= _ (wL_%)10sin(wt+(p) (39)
For a given an, the combination is evidently equivalent to a single ele-
ment, either an inductor or a capacitor, depending on whether the

1 .
quantity (ooL - TC) is positive or negative. Suppose, for example,

that wL >  Then the combination is equivalent to an inductor
OJ

L' such that

, 1

wL _ wL - E (40)
Equivalence means only that the relation between current and
voltage, for steady oscillation at the particular frequency w, is the
same. This allows us to replace L and C by L' in any circuit driven

at this frequency.
This can be applied to the simple RLC circuit in Fig. 8.9. We need
only recall Eqs. 23 and 27, the solution for the RL circuit driven by

the electromotive force 80 cos wt, and replace wL by wL - l/coC:

_ 50
tan (p = RLW _ '~1'TL (42)

For fixed amplitude 80 of the electromotive force, and given circuit
elements L, C, and R, we get the greatest current when the driving
frequency co is such that

1

-:= 4
wL wc 0 (3)

% p. 283
which is the same as saying that w = 1/ LC = «:0, the resonant
frequency of the undamped LC circuit. In that case Eq. 39 reduces to

80 COS wt

I: R

(44)

This is exactly the current that would flow if the circuit contained
the resistor alone.

As an example, consider the circuit of Fig. 8.3a, connected now
to a source or generator of alternating emf, 8 = 80 cos cat. The driving
frequency to may be different from the resonant frequency
we = 1/ \/IT', which, for the given capacitance (0.01 microfarads)
and the inductance (100 microhenrys), is 106 radians/ sec (or 106/2w
cycles/sec). Figure 8.10 shows the amplitude of the oscillating cur-
rent, as a function of the driving frequency w, for three different

R = 20 ohms

% p. 284
values of the circuit resistance R. It is assumed that the amplitude 80
of the emf is 100 volts in each case. Notice the resonance peak at
w = we, which is most prominent and sharp for the lowest resistance
value. This is the same value of R for which, running as a damped
oscillator without any driving emf, the circuit behaved as shown in
the top graph of Fig. 8.31).
The Qofthe circuit definedb E 14 L ' -___('°6 X 10%)

or 5, in this case. Generally speaking, the higher the Q of a circuit,
the narrower and higher the peak of its response as a function of
driving frequency co. To be more precise, consider frequencies in
the neighborhood of mo, writing a: = mg + Aw. Then to first order
in Aw/coo, the expression wL - 1/o.>C which occurs in the denomi-

nator in Eq. 41 can be approximated this way:

1 < Aw) I
L _ - = L 1 - _ L; 45
"' "'° 'L w0C(l + Aw/mo) ( )

woL [1 + A1 - -L-] : woL (2 fo-:°) (46)

Exactly at resonance, the quantity inside the square root sign in
Eq. 41 is just R2. As on is shifted away from resonance the quantity
under the square root will have doubled when |wL - l/wC| = R,
or when, approximately,

2Aw R l
= = - 47
000 LOOL Q ( )

This means that the current amplitude will have fallen to 1/ \/7 times
the peak when Aw/coo = 1/2Q. These are the ``half-power'' points.
because the energy, or power is proportional to the amplitude
squared, as we shall explain in Sec. 8.5. One often expresses the
width of a resonance peak by giving the full width between half-
power points. Evidently that is just 1/ Q times the resonant frequency
itself. Circuits with very much higher Q than this one are
quite common. A radio receiver may select a particular station and

TThe w in Eq. 14 was the frequency of the freely decaying damped oscillator, practically
the same as too for moderate or light damping. We use we here in the definition
of Q. In the present discussion to is any frequency we may choose to apply to this circuit.

% p. 285
discriminate against others by the help of a resonant circuit with a Q
of several hundred. It is quite easy to make a microwave resonant
circuit with a Q of 104, or even 105.

The angle q), which expresses the relative phase of the current and
emf oscillations, varies with frequency in the manner shown in
Fig. 8.11. At a very low frequency the capacitor is the dominant
hindrance to current flow, and (p is positive. At resonance, (p = 0.
The higher the Q, the more abruptly $\pot$ shifts from positive to negative
angles as the frequency is raised through coo.

8.3 Alternating-current Networks

An alternating-current network is any collection of resistors,
capacitors, and inductors in which currents flow that are oscillating
steadily at the constant frequency to. One or more electromotive
forces, at this frequency, drive the oscillation. Figure 8.12 is a diagram
of one such network. . The source of alternating electromotive
force is represented by the symbol  In a branch of the network,

for instance the branch that includes the inductor L2, the current as
a function of time is

I2 = 102 COS (wt + (pg) 

Since the frequency is a constant for the whole network, two num-
bers, such as the amplitude I02 and the phase constant (122 above, are
enough to determine for all time the current in a particular branch.

 

% p. 286
Similarly, the voltage across a branch oscillates with a certain
amplitude and phase:

V2 : V02 COS (wt + 02) 

If we have determined the currents and voltages in all branches of
a network, we have analyzed it completely. To find them by constructing
and solving all the appropriate differential equations is
possible, of course; and if we were concerned with the transient behavior
of the network, we might have to do something like that. For
the steady state, however, we can use a far simpler and more elegant
method. It is based on two ideas:

(i) An alternating current or voltage can be represented by a
complex number.

(ii) Any one branch or element of the circuit can be charac-
terized, at a given frequency, by the relation between the
voltage and current in that branch.

The first idea exploits that remarkable mathematical identity
e" = cos 0 + 2' sin 0 (50)

with i2 = - 1. To carry it out we adopt the following rule for the
representation:

  

An alternating current 10 cos (wt + q:) is to be represented
by the complex number Ioeiw, that is, the number whose real
part is I0 cos q: and whose imaginary part is 10 sin tp.

Going the other way, if the complex number x + iy represents
a current I, then the current as a function of time is given
by the real part of the product (3: + iy)ei~'.

      
   
 
    

Figure 8.13 is a reminder of this two-way correspondence. Since
a complex number z = x + iy can be graphically represented on the
two-dimensional plane, it is easy to visualize the phase constant as
the angle tan'1 y/x, and the amplitude Io as the modulus 

What makes all this useful is the following fact: The representation
of the sum of two currents is the sum of their representations. Consider
the sum of two currents I1 and 12 that meet at a junction of wires in
Fig. 8.12. At any instant of time t the sum of the currents is:

11 + 12 = 101 C08 (cot + (pi) + 102 cos (wt + (P2)

= (101 cos (p1 + 102 cos (P2) cos wt
- (I01 Sl1'l (P1 + 102 SlI'l (P2) SlI'l wt 

% p. 287
On the other hand, the sum of the complex numbers that, according
to our rule, represent I1 and I2 is:

1016*?' + 10291" = (101 005 'P1 + 102 005 #32)
+ i(Io1 Sin 'P1 + 102 Sin (P2) (52)

If you multiply the right-hand side of Eq. 52 by (cos wt + i sin wt)
and take the real part of the result, you will get just what appears or
the right in Eq. 51.

This means that instead of adding or subtracting the periodic functions
of time themselves, we can add or subtract the complex numbers
that represent them. Or putting it another way, the algebra of alternating
currents turns out to be the same as the algebra of complex
numbers, in respect to addition. The correspondence does not extend
to multiplication. The complex number Io1I02e"W1+W2) does not
represent the product of the two current functions in Eq. 51.

However, it is only the addition of currents and voltages that we
need to carry out in analyzing the network. For example, at the
junction where 11 meets 12 in Fig. 8.12, there is the physical requirement
that at every instant the net flow of current into the junction
shall be zero. Hence the condition

I1-{-I2-I-13:0 

must hold, where 11, I2, and 13 are the actual periodic functions of
time. Thanks to our correspondence, this can be expressed in the

% p. 288
simple algebraic statement that the sum of three complex numbers
is zero. Voltages can be handled in the same way. Instantaneously,
the sum of the voltage drops around any loop in the network must
equal the electromotive force in the loop at that instant. This condition
relating periodic voltage functions can likewise be replaced by
a statement about the sum of some complex numbers, the representations
of the various oscillating functions, V1(t), V2(t), etc.

8.4 Admittance and Impedance

The relation between current flow in a circuit element and the
voltage across the element can be expressed as a relation between the
complex numbers that represent the voltage and the current. Look
at the inductor-resistor combination in Fig. 8.4. The voltage oscillation
is represented by 80 and the current by Ioetw, where 10 =
80/ x/B2 + ML? and tan go = -wL/R. The phase difference (p and
the ratio of current amplitude to voltage amplitude are properties

of the circuit at this frequency. We define a complex number Y as
follows:

eiw
, /R2 +?w2L2

Then the relation

wL

Y = with (,5 = tan'1<- -R-) (54)

1 = YV (55)

holds, where V is the complex number that represents the Voltage
across the series combination of R and L, and I is the complex number
that represents the current. Y is called the admittance. The

same relation can be expressed with the reciprocal of Y, denoted by
Z and called the impedance:

V =  I = Z1 (56)

Here we do make use of the product of two complex numbers, but
only one of the numbers is the representation of an alternating current
or Voltage. The other is the impedance or admittance.T

TOur algebra thus contains two categories of complex numbers, those that represent
impedances, for example, and those that represent currents. The product of two

``impedance numbers,'' like the product of two ``current numbers,'' doesn't represent
anything.

% p. 289
The impedance is measured in ohms. Indeed, if the circuit element
had consisted of the resistance R alone, the impedance would
be real and equal simply to R, so that Eq. 56 would resemble Ohm's
law for a direct-current circuit: V = R1.

The admittance of a resistanceless inductor is the imaginary
quantity Y = -i/wL. This can be seen by letting R go to zero in
Eq. 54. The factor ---i shows that the current oscillation lags the
voltage oscillation by 77/2 in phase. On the complex number dia-
gram, if the voltage is represented by V (Fig. 8.1419), the current
might be represented by I, located as shown there. For the capacitor,
Y = icoC, as can be seen from the expression for the current in
Fig. 8.7. In this case V and I are related as indicated in Fig. 8.140.
The inset in each of the figures shows how the relative sign of Vand I
is to be specified. Unless that is done consistently, ``leading'' and
``lagging'' are meaningless. Note that we always define the positive
current direction so that a positive voltage applied to a resistor causes
positive current (Fig. 8.l4a).

The properties of the three basic circuit elements are summarized
below:

Symbol Admittance, Y Impedance, Z = LY
R L R
JWW R
L  1'¢..>L
'\U.Qr wL
C .
' C ;'
_H- W wC
I = YV V = Z1

We can build up any circuit from these elements. When elements
or combinations of elements are connected in parallel, it is convenient
to use the admittance, for in that case admittances add. In Fig. 8.15
two ``black boxes'' with admittances Y1 and Y2 are connected in
parallel. We have then

I = 11 + 12 = Y1V+ Y2V= (Y1 + Y2)V (57)

% p. 290
  

which implies that the equivalent single black box has an admittance
Y = Y1 + Y2. From Fig. 8.16 it will be obvious that the impedances
add for elements connected in series. It sounds as if we are talking
about a direct-current network! In fact, we have now reduced the
ac network problem to the dc network problem, with only this dif-
ference: the numbers we deal with arecomplex numbers.

As an example, let's look at the ``parallel RLC'' circuit in
Fig. 8.17. The combined admittance of the three parallel branches is

_L - _;'
Y_R+1wC COL (53)

The voltage is simply 80, so the complex current is
1: YV= s0[-+i(wc_i)] (59)

The amplitude of the current oscillation is the modulus of the complex
number I, which is 80[(l/R)? + (wC - 1/wL)2]1/2, and the
phase angle is tan'1 (RwC - R/wL).

We can only deal in this way with linear circuit elements, elements
in which the current is proportional to the voltage. In other words,
our circuit must be described by a linear differential equation. You
can't even define an impedance for a nonlinear element. Nonlinear
circuit elements are very important and interesting devices. You
have studied some in the laboratory, and you can see why they will
not readily yield to this kind of analysis.

This is all predicated, too, on the continuous oscillation at constant
frequency. The transient behavior of the circuit is a different
problem. However, for linear circuits the tools we have just developed
have some utility, even for transients. The reason is that by
superposing steady oscillations of many frequencies we can represent
a nonsteady behavior, and the response to each of the individual
frequencies can be calculated as if that frequency were present alone.
This can well be left for Volume III.

8.5 Power and Energy in Altemating-current Circuits
If the voltage across a resistor R is V0 cos cat, the current is
I : (V0/R) cos Lot. The instantaneous power, that is the instantaneous
rate at which energy is being dissipated in the resistor is
V02

P = R12 = T cos? wt (60)

% p. 291
Since the average of cos? out over many cycles is %, the average power
dissipated in the circuit is

1 V02

P=_:
2 R

(61)

It is customary to express voltage and current in ac circuits by giving
not the amplitude but 1/ \/7 times the amplitude. This is often called
the ``root-mean-square'' or, for short, ``rms'' value. That takes care
of the factor 4 in Eq. 61, so that

V%ms

(62)

For example, the common domestic line voltage, 120 volts, corresponds
to an amplitude 120\/7 volts. The potential difference be-

tween the terminals of the electric outlet in your room (if the voltage
is up to normal) is

V(t) = 170 cos 377t (63)

with Vin volts and t in seconds. An ac ammeter is calibrated to read
1 amp when the current amplitude is 1.414 amperes.

In general, the instantaneous rate at which energy is delivered to
a circuit element is VI, the product of the instantaneous voltage and
current, with due regard to sign. Consider this aspect of the current
flow in the simple LR circuit in Fig. 8.4. In Fig. 8.18 we have redrawn
the current and voltage graphs and added a curve proportional to
the product VI. Positive VI means energy is being transferred into
the LR combination from the source of electromotive force, or
generator. Notice that VI is negative in certain parts of the cycle.
In those periods some energy is being returned to the generator.
This is explained by the oscillation in the energy stored in the magnetic
field of the inductor. This stored energy, §LI2, goes through
a maximum twice in each full cycle.

The average power, 13, corresponds to the horizontal dashed line.
To calculate its value, let's look at the product V1, with V = 80 cos out
and 1 : 10 cos (wt + (P):

VI = 8010 cos cot cos (cot + (p)
: 80I0(cos 2 cot cos (p - cos cot sin wt sin (p) (64)

9.1 Dielectrics

The capacitor we studied in Chap. 3.consisted of two conductors,
insulated from one another, with nothing in between. The system
of two conductors was characterized by a certain capacitance C. a
constant relating the magnitude of the charge Q on the capacitor
(positive charge Q on one plate, equal negative charge on the other)
to V12, the difference in electrical potential between the two con-
ductors:

Q

C =  ---  1
V12 ( )
For the parallel-plate capacitor, two flat plates each of area A cm?

and separated by a distance t, we found that the capacitance is
given by

_ A
C_ 4'n't (2)

Capacitors like this can be found in some electrical apparatus. They
are called vacuum capacitors and consist of plates enclosed in a highly
evacuated bottle. They are used chiefly where extremely high and
rapidly varying potentials are involved. Far more common, how-
ever, are capacitors in which the space between the plates is filled
with some nonconducting solid or liquid substance. Most of the
capacitors you have worked with in the laboratory are of that sort;
there are dozens of them in any television receiver. For conductors
embedded in a material medium, Eq. 2 doesn't agree with experiment.
Suppose we fill the space between the two plates shown in Fig. 9.1a
with a slab of plastic, as in Fig. 9.119. Experimenting with this new
capacitor, we still find a simple proportionality between charge and
potential difierence, so that we can still define a capacitance by Eq. 1.
But we find C to be substantially larger than Eq. 2 would predict.

Not only in the special devices called capacitors, but almost everywhere
in the world around us, the electric and magnetic fields exist
in the presence of matter rather than in a vacuum --- if not in dense
matter, then at least in a gas, namely air. All this is to remind us
that, except for our excursion in Chap. 4 into the subject of electrical
conduction, we have really been studying the electromagnetic field
in empty space populated only by certain point charges or smooth

% p. 299
charge distributions. Now we must seek to understand the interactions
of electric and magnetic fields with matter in bulk.

Two different approaches are open to us. Maintaining a large-
scale, or macroscopic, point of view, we could see how the presence
of a block of homogeneous material like the plastic slab in Fig. 9.lb
affects the electric field in the space outside, where we can measure
the field. We could try to discover simple laws which would adequately
describe such effects in any system of conductors and in-
sulators. We would find that the macroscopic electric behavior of
homogeneous substances can indeed be characterized fairly simply
and completely. Equation 2, for example, needs only the insertion
on the right-hand side of a constant factor 5, characteristic of the particular
substance, to give correctly the capacitance of any capacitor
filled with that material. 5 is called the dielectric constant of that
substance, and the material itselfis generally referred to as a dielectric
when we are considering its behavior in an electric field. Dielectric
constants of some common substances are listed in Table 9.1. Once
the dielectric constant of a particular material has been determined,
perhaps by measuring the capacitance of one capacitor filled with it,

we are able to predict the behavior, not merely of two-plate capac-
itors, but of any electrostatic system made up of conductors and
pieces of that dielectric of any shape. That is, we can predict all
electric fields which will exist in the vacuum outside the dielectrics
for given charges or potentials on the conductors in the system.

The theory which enables us to do this was fully worked out by
the physicists of the nineteenth century. ‘ Lacking a complete picture
of the atomic structure of matter, they were more or less obliged to
adopt a macroscopic description. From that point of view, the interior
of a dielectric is a featureless expanse of perfectly smooth
``mathematical jelly'' whose single electrical property distinguishing
it from a vacuum is a dielectric constant difl"erent from unity.

If we develop only a macroscopic description of matter in an
electric field, we shall find it hard to answer some rather obvious-
sounding questions --- or rather, hard to ask these questions in such
a way that they can be meaningfully answered. For instance, what
is the strength of the electric field inside the plastic slab of Fig. 9.lb
when there are certain charges on the plates? Electric field strength
is defined by the force on a test charge. How can we put a test charge
inside a perfectly dense solid, without disturbing anything, and
measure the force on it? What would that force mean, if we did
measure it? You might think of boring a hole and putting the test
charge in the hole with some room to move around, so that you can
measure the force on it as on a free particle. But then you will be
measuring, not the electric field in the dielectric, but the electric field
in a cavity in the dielectric, which is quite a different thing.

Fortunately another line of attack is available to us, one that leads
up from the microscopic or atomic level. We know that matter is
made of atoms and molecules; these in turn are composed of elementary
charged particles. We know something about the size and
structure of these atoms, and we know something about their arrangement
in crystals and fluids and gases. Instead of describing our
dielectric slab as a volume of structureless but nonvacuous jelly, we
shall describe it as a collection of molecules inhabiting a vacuum.
If we can find out what the electric charges in one molecule do when
that molecule is all by itself in an electric field, we should be able to
understand the behavior of two such molecules a certain distance
apart in a vacuum. It will only be necessary to include the influence,
on each molecule, of any electric field arising from the other. This
is a vacuum problem. Now all we have to do is extend this to a population
of say 1020 molecules occupying a cubic centimeter or so of

% p. 301
vacuum, and we have our real dielectric. We hope to do this without
generating 1020 separate problems.

This program if carried through will reward us in two ways. We
shall be able at last to say something meaningful about the electric
and magnetic fields inside matter, answering questions such as the
one raised above. What is more valuable, we shall understand how
the macroscopic electric and magnetic phenomena in matter arise
from, and therefore reveal, the nature of the underlying atomic struc-
ture. We are going to study electric and magnetic effects separately.
We begin with dielectrics. Since our first goal is to describe the electric
field produced by an atom or molecule, it will help to make some

general observations about the electrostatic field external to any small
system of charges.

9.2 The Moments of a Charge Distribution

An atom or molecule consists of some electric charges occupying
a small volume, perhaps a few cubic angstroms (1O‘24 cm3) of space.
We are interested in the electric field outside that volume, which
arises from this rather complicated charge distribution. We shall
be particularly concerned with the field far away from the source,
by which we mean far away compared to the size of the source itself.
What features of the charge structure mainly determine the field at
remote points? To answer this, let's look at some arbitrary distribution
of charges and see how we might go about computing the field
at a point outside it. Figure 9.2 shows a charge distribution of some
sort located in the neighborhood of the origin of coordinates. It
might be a molecule consisting of several positive nuclei and quite
a large number of electrons. In any case we shall suppose it is described
by a given charge density function p(x,y,z). p is negative
where the electrons are and positive where the nuclei are. To find
the electric field at distant points we can begin by computing the
potential of the charge distribution. To illustrate, let's take some
point A out on the z axis.‘ (Since we are not assuming any special
symmetry in the charge distribution, there is nothing special about
the z axis.) Let r be the distance of A from the origin. The electric
potential at A, denoted by <;oA, is obtained as usual by adding the
contributions from all elements of the charge distribution:

,, :  (3,

% p. 302
In the integrand do' is an element of volume within the charge dis-
tribution, p(x',y',z') is the charge density there, and R in the denominator
is the distance from A to this particular charge element. The
integration is carried out in the coordinates x', y', z', of course, and
is extended over all the region containing charge. We can express R
in terms of r and the distance 1' from the origin to the charge element.

Using the law of cosines with 0 the angle between 1' and the axis on
which A lies:

R = [r2 + 1/2 _ 2n' cos 011/2 (4)

With this substitution for R the integral becomes:
q,)A =fpdo'[r2 + 1/2 _ 2n' cos 6]-1/2 (4a)

Now we want to take advantage of the fact that for a distant point
like A, 1' is much smaller than r for all parts of the charge distribution.
This suggests that we should expand the square root in Eq. 4 in
powers of 1' /1. Writing

[r2 + 1/2 _ 2w cos 01-1/2 = L [1 +  _ 3'- --- " cos 0)?'' (5)
r r r
and using the expansion (1 + 8)‘1/2 = 1  ---  {6 + gaz ~-, we get,

after collecting together terms of the same power in 1"/r:

[12 + /2  ---  2rr' cos 0]"-1/2

_l _1/_ L2(3cos20 --- l) < terms of 
"rl1+rCOs0+lr>f+ higherpower (6)

Now r is a constant in the integration, so we can take it outside and
write the prescription for the potential at A as follows:

<p,4 = %fp dv' + %f1' cos 0 p do'
+x --- ' 4-\/ ---  --- -'

K0 K1
2 _
+ %f',2'(3 Cos20*1)pdv' +  (7)
K2

Each of the integrals above, K0, K1, K2, and so on, has a value that
depends only on the structure of the charge distribution. Hence the

% p. 303
potential for all points along the z axis can be written as a power series
in l /r with constant coefficients:

-52 E K2
<z>.4 --- r+r,+r3+--- (8)

To finish the problem we would have to get the electric field at all
other points, in order to calculate the electric field as  --- grad (p. We
have gone far enough, though, to bring out the essential point: The
behavior of the potential at large distances from the source will be
dominated by the first term in this series whose coeflicient is not zero.

Let us look at these coefficients more closely. The coeflicient K0
is f p do', which is nothing but the total charge in the distribution.
If we have equal amounts of positive and negative charge, as in a
neutral molecule, K0 will be zero. For a singly ionized molecule K0
will have the value e. If K0 is not zero, then no matter how large
K1, K2, etc., may be, if we go out to a sufliciently large distance the
term K0/ r will win out. Beyond that, the potential will approach that
of a point charge at the origin and so will the field. This is hardly
surprising.

Suppose we have a neutral molecule, so that K0 is zero. Our interest
now shifts to the second term, with coefficient K1 = f 1' cos 0 p do'.
Since r' cos 0 is simply z', this term measures the relative displace-
ment, in the direction toward A, of the positive and negative charge.
It has a nonzero value for the distributions sketched in Fig. 9.3, where
the densities of positive and of negative charge have been indicated
separately. In fact, all the distributions shown there have approximately
the same value of K1.

It is worth noting that if the distribution is neutral the value of K1
is independent of the position of the origin. That is, if we replace
z' by (z' + z(1), thus in effect shifting the origin, the value of the integral
is not changed: f(z' + z6)p do' = fz'p dv' + zé f p do' and the
latter integral is always zero for a neutral distribution.

Evidently if K0 = O and K1 7': 0, the potential along the z axis will
vary asymptotically (that is, with ever --- closer approximation as we
go out to larger distances) as 1/12. We expect the electric field
strength, then, to behave asymptotically like 1/13, in contrast to the
1 /r2 dependence of the field from a point charge. Of course we have
discussed only the potential on the z axis. We will return to the question
of the exact form of the field after getting a general view of the
situation.

% p. 304
 

If K0 and K1 are both zero, and K2 is not, the potential will behave
like 1/13 at large distances, and the field strength will fall off with
the inverse fourth power of the distance. Figure 9.4 shows a charge
distribution for which K0 and K1 are both zero (and would be zero
no matter what direction we had chosen for the z axis) while K2 is
not zero.

The quantities K0, K1, K2, . . . are related to what are called the
moments of the charge distribution. Using this language, we call K0,
which is simply the net charge, the monopole moment, or monopole
strength. K1 is one component of the dipole moment of the distri-
bution. The dipole moment has the dimensions charge times dis-
placement; it is a vector and our K1 is its z component. The third
constant K2 is related to the quadrupole moment of the distribution,
the next to the octupole moment, and so on.'r

The advantage to us of describing a charge distribution by this
hierarchy of moments is that it singles out just those features of the
charge distribution which determine the field at a great distance. If
we were concerned only with the field in the immediate neighborhood
of the distribution, it would be a fruitless exercise. For our main task,
understanding what goes on in a dielectric, it turns out that only the
monopole strength (the net charge) and the dipole strength of the
molecular building blocks matter. We can ignore all other moments.
And if the building blocks are neutral, we have only their dipole
moments to consider.

9.3 The Potential and Field of a Dipole

The dipole contribution to the potential at the point A, distance
r from the origin, was given by (1/r2)fr' cos 0 p do'. We can write
1' cos 0, which is just the projection of r' on the direction toward A,
as f - r'. Thus we can write the potential without reference to any
arbitrary axis as

1 A ; /_‘_ ,
(pA:-;5fl"l'pdv_: fr'pdv (9)

which will serve to give the potential at any point. The integral on
the right in Eq. 9 is the dipole moment of the charge distribution. It

Tlt can be shown that decomposition of the source into various multipoks, if carried
through completely, uniquely specifies the charge distribution. In other words, if we
know all the multipole strengths we can ``in principle'' deduce p(x',y'.z'). This is not
very useful. The quadrupole and higher moments are not vectors, by the way, but
more complicated entities.

% p. 305
is a vector, obviously, with the dimensions charge times distance. We
shall denote the dipole moment vector by p:

p =fr'p do' (10)

Using the dipole moment p, we can rewrite Eq. 9 as

<p<r> = "P (11)

r2

The electric field is the negative gradient of this potential. To see
what the dipole field is like, locate a dipole p at the origin, pointing
in the z direction (Fig. 9.5). With this arrangement,

_pcos0

(P  ---  (12)

% p. 306
The potential and the field are, of course, symmetrical around the
z axis. Let's work in the xz plane, where cos 0 = z/ (x2 + z2)1/2. In
that plane, then

_ P3

The components of the electric field are readily derived:

2 p(3 cos? 0 -1)
13

Proceeding out in any direction from the dipole, we find the electric
field strength falling off as 1/13, as we had anticipated. Along
the z axis the field is parallel to the dipole moment p, with magnitude
2p/1'3. In the equatorial plane the field points antiparallel to p and
has the value  --- p/13.

This field may remind you of one we have met before. Remember
the point charge over the conducting plane, with its ``image charge.''

% p. 307
Perhaps the simplest charge distribution with a dipole moment is two
point charges, +q and  --- q, separated by a distance s. For a system
of point charges Eq. 10 takes the form of a sum. The dipole moment
of our point-charge pair is just qs, and the vector points in the direction
from negative charge to positive. In Fig. 9.6 we have sketched
the field of this pair of charges, mainly to emphasize that the field
near the charges is not a dipole field. This charge distribution has
many multipole moments, indeed infinitely many, so it is only the
``far field'' at distances r > s that can be represented as a dipole field.

To generate a complete dipole field right in to the origin we would
have to let s shrink to zero while increasing q without limit so as to
keep p = qs finite. This highly singular abstraction is not very in-
teresting. We know that our molecular charge distribution will have
complicated near fields, so we could not easily represent the near
region in any case. Fortunately we shall not need to.

9.4 The Torque and the Force on a Dipole in an External Field

Suppose two charges q and  --- q are mechanically connected so
that s, the distance between them, is fixed. You may think of the
charges as stuck on the end of a short nonconducting rod of length 3.
We shall call this object a dipole. Its dipole moment p is simply qs.
Let us put the dipole in an external electric field, that is, the field from
some other source. The field of the dipole itself does not concern
us now. Consider first a uniform electric field, as in Fig. 9.7a. The
positive end of the dipole is pulled toward the right, the negative end
toward the left, by a force of strength Eq. The net force on the object
is zero and so is the torque, in this position. A dipole which makes
some angle 0 with the field direction as in Fig. 9.71) obviously experiences
a torque. In general, torque N is r x F where F is the force
applied at a distance r from the origin (Vol. 1, Chap. 6). Taking the
origin in the center of the dipole, so that r = s/2, we have

N:-rxF++( --- r)xF_ (15)

N is a vector perpendicular to the figure, and its magnitude is:
N=§rygn0+§rqgno=amgn0=pEan0 am

This can be written simply

N=pxE an

% p. 308
  

The orientation of the dipole in Fig. 9.7a has the lowest energy.
Work has to be done to rotate it into any other position. Let us calculate
the work required to rotate the dipole from a position parallel
to the field, through some angle 00, as shown in Fig. 9.70. Rotation
through an infinitesimal angle d0 requires an amount of work N d0.
Thus the total work done is

f0''°Nd0=f0''°pEsmod9=pE(1_cos00) (18)

To reverse the dipole, turning it end for end, corresponds to 00 = 77
and requires an amount of work equal to 2pE.

The net force on the dipole in any uniform field is zero, obviously.
regardless of its orientation. In a nonuniform field the forces on the
two ends of the dipole will generally not be exactly equal and op-
posite, and there will be a net force on the object. A simple example
is a dipole in the field of a point charge Q. If the dipole is oriented
radially as in Fig. 9.8a, with the positive end nearer the positive
charge Q, the net force will be outward, and its magnitude will be

F= <q>% + ( --- q)(%) --- 2 (19)

For .9 < r, we need only evaluate this to first order in s/r, which we
do as follows:

F=gr2Ql‘ 1s2]:_zT[1~%s]:% <20'
(1 + 7) 1 + 7
In terms of the dipole moment p, this is simply
F = 349 (21)

13

With the dipole at right angles to the field, as in Fig. 9.81), there is
also a force. Now the forces on the two ends, though equal, are not
exactly opposite in direction.

It is not hard to work out a general formula for the force on a dipole
in a nonuniform electric field. The force depends essentially on the
gradients of the various components of the field. In general, the
x component of the force on a dipole of moment p is

F, = p - grad E, (22)

with corresponding formulas for F, and F3.

9.5 Atomic and Molecular Dipoles; Induced Dipole Moments

In describing the charge distribution in an atom or molecule we
shall have to use classical terms to depict a quantum mechanical
system. Also, we shall be treating as static a structure in which the
particles are, in some sense, continually in motion. Later in the
course, in Vol. IV, you will see how quantum mechanics, far from discrediting
the picture we are about to sketch, reassuringly supports it.

Consider the simplest atom, the hydrogen atom, which consists of
a nucleus and one electron. If you imagine the negatively charged
electron revolving around the positive nucleus like a planet around
the sun --- as in the original atomic model of Niels Bohr --- you will
conclude that the atom has, at any one instant of time, an electric
dipole moment. The dipole moment vector p points parallel to the
electron --- proton radius vector, and its magnitude is e times the
electron --- proton distance. The direction of this vector is continually
and rapidly changing as the electron circles around its orbit. To be
sure, the time average of p will be zero for a circular orbit, but we
should expect the periodically changing dipole moment components
to generate rapidly oscillating electric fields and electromagnetic
radiation. The absence of such radiation in the normal hydrogen
atom was one of the great paradoxes of early quantum physics.
Modern quantum mechanics tells us that it is better to think of the
hydrogen atom in its lowest energy state (the usual condition of most
of the hydrogen atoms in the universe) as a spherically symmetrical
structure with the electronic charge distributed, in the time average,
over a cloud surrounding the nucleus. Nothing is revolving or
oscillating. If we could take a snapshot with an exposure time
shorter than l0‘15 seconds, we might discern an electron localized
some distance away from the nucleus. But for processes involving
times much longer than that we have, in effect, a smooth distribution
of negative charge surrounding the nucleus and extending out in all
directions with steadily decreasing density. The total charge in this
distribution is just  --- e. the charge of one electron. Roughly half of
it lies within a sphere of radius 0.5 angstrom (0.5 X 10-8 cm). The
density decreases exponentially outward; a sphere only 2.2 angstroms
in radius contains 99 percent of the charge.

A similar picture is the best one to adopt for other atoms and mole-
cules. We can treat the nuclei in molecules as point charges; for our
present purposes their size is too small to matter. The entire electronic
structure of the molecule is to be pictured as a single cloud of
negative charge of smoothly varying density. The shape of this cloud

% p. 310
and the variation of charge density within it will of course be dilferent
for different molecules. But at the fringes of the cloud the density
will always fall off exponentially, so that it makes some sense to talk
of the size and shape of the molecular charge distribution.

Figure 9.9 represents the charge distribution in the normal hydrogen
atom. It is a cross section through t-he spherically symmetrical
cloud, with the density suggested by shading. Obviously the dipole
moment of such a distribution is zero. The same is true of any atom
in its state of lowest energy, no matter how many electrons it con-
tains, for in all such states the electron distribution has spherical
symmetry. It is also true of any ionized atom, though an ion, of
course, has a ``monopole moment,'' that is, a net charge.

So far we have nothing very interesting. But now let us put the
hydrogen atom in an electric field supplied by some external source,
as in Fig. 9.10. The electric field distorts the atom, pulling the negative
charge down and pushing the positive nucleus up. The distorted
atom will have an electric dipole moment because the ``center of
gravity'' of the positive charge and that of the negative charge no
longer coincide.

We can use a makeshift model of the hydrogen atom to estimate,
in order of magnitude, the amount of distortion to be expected.
Suppose that in the absence of an electric field the negative electric
charge e is distributed with constant density throughout a sphere of
radius a, outside which it is zero. Figure 9.1 1 shows this crude substitute
for the real distribution depicted in Fig. 9.9. Assume that
when the field E is applied, this ball of negative charge keeps its shape
and density and is merely displaced, relative to the nucleus, so that
the nucleus ends up some distance 12 from the center of the sphere
(Fig. 9.12). In equilibrium, the force on the nucleus due to the electric
field E, a force of eE dynes acting upward, must be balanced by
the downward attraction exerted on the nucleus by the negative
charge cloud, which pulls the nucleus toward its center. To find the
magnitude of the latter force, we recall that inside a spherical charge
distribution, at a point 19 cm from the center, the electric field is
simply that due to the charge inside a sphere of radius b. In this case
the amount of charge inside the sphere of radius 12 is (b/a)3e, since e
is the amount of charge inside the sphere of radius a. At the location
of the nucleus, therefore, the field arising from the electron cloud is
just (1 /b2)e(b/(1)3 or eb/a3. Setting this field strength equal to that
of the applied field E gives the equilibrium condition:

eb

E = ? from which b = E (23)

6

% p. 311
As a good round number let's put in 1 angstrom, or 10‘3 cm, for a.
We have suggested that a radius of that magnitude would include
most of the charge in the true distribution. For E we'll try 100 stat-
volts/cm. That is 30,000 volts/cm, a pretty strong electric field as
fields go in the laboratory. With these assumptions, Eq. 23 yields
for b the magnitude 2 x 10‘13 cm. The distortion is very slight. The
displacement is about 10‘5 of the atomic radius, not much more than
the radius of the nucleus. The resulting electric dipole moment is eb,

so that the relation between dipole moment and applied field, in this
model, is

,9 = eb = a3E (24)

The direction of the dipole moment vector is upward, that is, in the
same direction as the electric field.

Notice that the dipole moment is simply proportional to the applied
field. We can expect that this will be true in the real atom, at
least for small distortions, and our calculation strongly suggests that
any reasonable laboratory field perturbs an atom only very slightly.
Any atom can be polarized in this way. We say that the dipole
moment is induced by the electric field E. In every case we find that
p is proportional to E:

P = aE (25)

The constant a is a property of the atom called the atomic
polarizability.

For our model of the hydrogen atom the polarizability a is equal
to (13. Notice that at has the dimensions of volume. An exact
quantum mechanical calculation of the pola rizability of the hydrogen
atom predicts a = (9/2)a03, where a0 is the ``Bohr radius,''
0.52 X l0‘3 cm, the characteristic distance in the H atom structure
in its normal state. The electric polarizabilities of several species of
atoms, experimentally determined, are given in Table 9.2. The ex-

amples given are arranged in order of increasing numbers of elec-
trons. Notice the wide variations in a. If you are acquainted with
the Periodic Table of the elements, you may discern something systematic
here. Hydrogen and the alkali metals, lithium, sodium, and

% p. 312
potassium, which occupy the first column of the Periodic Table, have
large values of a and these increase steadily with increasing atomic
number, from hydrogen to potassium. The noble gases have much
smaller atomic polarizabilities, but these also increase as we proceed,
within the family, from helium to neon to krypton. Apparently the
alkali atoms, as a class, are easily deformed by an electric field,
whereas the electronic structure of a noble gas atom is much stiffer.
It is the loosely bound outer, or ``valence,'' electron in the alkali atom
structure that is responsible for the easy polarizability.

A molecule, too, develops an induced dipole moment when an
electric field is applied to it. The methane molecule depicted in
Fig. 9.13 is made from four hydrogen atoms arranged at the corners
of a tetrahedron around the central carbon atom. This object has
an electrical polarizability, determined experimentally, of

2.6 )< 10*`` cm3

It is interesting to compare this with the sum of the polarizabilities of
a carbon atom and four isolated hydrogen atoms. Taking the data
from Table 9.2, we find ac + 40:}; = 4.1 X 10-24 cm3. Evidently
the binding of the atoms into a molecule has somewhat altered the
electronic structure. Measurements of atomic and molecular polar-

izabilities have long been used by chemists as clues to molecular
structure.

9.6 The Polarizability Tensor

Molecules are necessarily less symmetrical than atoms. This raises
the possibility of an induced dipole moment not parallel to the electric
field that induced it. Consider the carbon dioxide molecule. It is
a linear ``cigar --- shaped'' molecule with constituent atoms arranged
as shown in Fig. 9.l4a. It would be surprising if this electronic structure
were equally stilf against longitudinal and transverse deforma-
tion. In general, we should expect that an electric field applied
parallel to the axis would cause an induced dipole moment different
in magnitude from that induced by a field of the same strength applied
at right angles to the molecular axis. Indeed, the observed
polarizability of the CO2 molecule is 4.05 X 10-24 cm3 for a field
applied parallel to the axis, and a little less than half that for a transverse
field. The molecule has two polarizabilities, which we might
label an and ai. What happens if we apply a field in some other
direction, as in Fig. 9.1419? That can be easily predicted. Because

% p. 313
we are dealing with a linear‘{' phenomenon (effect directly proportional
to cause) the superposition principle holds. We can resolve
the field E into components parallel and perpendicular to the molecular
axis. E'' = E cos 0 and E L = E sin 0. We can imagine these
components applied separately, and then combine the resulting
moment vectors. Eu induces a moment along the molecular axis of
magnitude p" = aHE1. = aHE cos 0. E L causes a moment perpendicular
to the axis: pi = aLE sin 0. These combine to make the magnetic
moment p caused by the original field E. The dipole moment
vector p is not parallel to E if oz" sé (xi. It points instead more nearly
in the direction of easy polarization. (Can you think of a mechanical
analog for this behavior?)

This example shows that the polarizability of a molecule is not a
simple number, a scalar, but rather a set of coeflicients that express
a linear dependence of the components of one Vector, p in this ex-
ample, on those of another, E. Such a set of coefficients is called a
tensor. The most general relation of this sort would appear to involve
nine coeflicients, and might be written in this way:

P1‘ = a:m:E.r + ‘Xz‘yE1/ + a.z'zEz
Py = ``WEI + °‘wEu ‘I' ayzEz (26)
P2 = az1'E:v + azyEy + azzE2

The nine a's defined in this way form what is known as the polar-
izability tensor.

In the example of the CO2 molecule, if we orient the x axis along
the axis of the molecule, the coefiicients become an : at'';
am, = aw : cg; and the six other coefficients are zero. Had we
chosen some other direction for the coordinate axis, say at 30° to the
molecular axis, a field E in the x direction, as in Fig. 9.14c would cause
a dipole moment p having a component in the z direction. So an
would not be zero. (You can find the value it would have by resolving
E into components parallel and perpendicular to the molecular
axis, finding the polarization induced by these, and then the z component
of the resultant.)‘ Thus the elements of the polarizability
tensor will depend on the orientation of the coordinate axes. They
must transform under a rotation of coordinate axes in such a way as
to preserve invariant the relation between the vectors E and p. This
relation can only depend on the direction of E with respect to the
physical axis of the molecule, and not on how we happen to lay out

'rWe are also dealing with a linear molecule (atoms arranged in a straight line)!
Linear has, of course, totally dilferent meanings in the two usages.

% p. 314
 

 

 

the x, y, and z axes. We shall not work out here the rules by which
the tensor coefficients transform. They are analogous to the rules
for the transformation of the components of a vector. If you want
to see how it goes with minimum labor, you might work it out for the
two-dimensional case, as suggested in Prob. 9.23.

In the polarizability tensor oz only six of the nine coefficients are
independent. It can be proved that. 01``, = am, an = oz'', and
aw = a,,,,. That is, the square array of nine numbers is always symmetrical
about the ``down-right'' diagonal. The symmetry of the
tensor expresses a most remarkable physical fact which deserves
some thought. It means that a field E applied in the x direction
always causes a z component of polarization exactly equal to the
x component of polarization that would be caused by an equal field
applied along the z direction. If you think this is obvious or trivial.
ponder the fact that it is true even for a molecule that has no symmetry
whatever, such as the molecule shown in Fig. 9.15. It is a kind
of ``reciprocity'' theorem which, like the equality of the mutual in-
ductances we proved in Sec. 7.7, arises not from mere geometrical
symmetry but from something more general. If you wonder how it
can be proved, Prob. 9.22 will show you.

An important corollary of the symmetry of a is the fact that it is
always possible to orient the axes, relative to the molecular frame-
work, so that the ``off-diagonal'' coefficients, aw, etc., will be zero.
In these coordinates the polarizability of the molecule is completely
described by three numbers am, aw, at''. And this is even true for
a molecule which has, itself, no symmetry at all. We shall not use
these facts in our limited study of dielectrics. They are extremely
important in the investigation of the optical properties of molecules
and are perhaps even more familiar to chemists, nowadays, than to
physicists. The chief purpose of this digression on the polarizability
tensor was to acquaint you, by means of this easily visualized ex-
ample, with the nature of a tensor.

9.7 Permanent Dipole Moments

Some molecules are so constructed that they have electric dipole
moments even in the absence of an electric field. They are unsymmetrical
already in their normal state. The molecule shown in
Fig. 9.15 is an example. A simpler example is provided by any
diatomic molecule made out of dissimilar atoms, such as hydrogen
chloride, HCl. There is no point on the axis of this molecule about

% p. 315
which the molecule is symmetrical fore and aft; the two ends of the
molecule are physically different. It would be a pure accident if the
``center of gravity'' of the positive charge and that of the negative
charge happened to fall at the same point along the axis. When
the HCl molecule is formed from the originally spherical H and Cl
atoms, the electron of the H atom shifts partially over to the Cl struc-
ture, leaving the hydrogen nucleus partially denuded. So there is
some excess of positive charge at the hydrogen end of the molecule
and a corresponding excess of negative charge at the chlorine end.
The magnitude of the resulting electric dipole moment, 1.03 x 10‘13
esu-cm, is equivalent to shifting one electron about one-fifth of an
angstrom. By contrast the hydrogen atom in a field of 30 kilo-
volts/cm, with the polarizability listed in Table 9.2, acquires an induced
moment less than 10-22 esu-cm. Permanent dipole moments,
when they exist, are as a rule enormously larger than any moment
that can be induced by ordinary laboratory electric fields.'l' Because
of this, the distinction between polar molecules, as molecules with
``built in'' dipole moments are called, and nonpolar molecules is very
sharp.

We said at the beginning of Sec. 9.5 that the hydrogen atom had,
at any instant of time, a dipole moment. But then we dismissed it
as being zero in the time average, on account of the rapid motion of
the electron. Now we seem to be talking about molecular dipole
moments as if a molecule were an ordinary stationary object like a
baseball bat whose ends could be examined at leisure to see which
was larger! Molecules move more slowly than electrons, but their
motion is rapid by ordinary standards. Why can we credit them with
``permanent'' electric dipole moments? If this inconsistency was
bothering you, you are to be commended. The full answer can't be
given without some quantum mechanics, but the diflerence essentially
involves the time scale of the motion. The time it takes a molecule
to interact with its surroundings is generally shorter than the
time it takes the intrinsic motion of the molecule to average out the
dipole moment smoothly." Hence the molecule really acts as if it had
the moment we have been talking about. A very short time qualifies
as ``permanent'' in the world of one molecule and its neighbors.

‘l'There is a good reason for this. The internal electric fields in atoms and molecules
are naturally of the order of e/(lO‘8 cm)? which is roughly 109 volts/cm! We

cannot apply such a field to matter in the laboratory for the closely related reason that
it would tear the matter to bits.

% p. 316
Some common polar molecules are shown in Fig. 9.16, with the
direction and magnitude of the permanent dipole moment indicated
for each. The water molecule has an electric dipole moment because
it is bent in the middle, the 0-H axes making an angle of about 105°
with one another. This is a structural oddity with the most far --- reaching
consequences. The dipole momentof the molecule is largely
responsible for the properties of water as a solvent, and it plays a
decisive role in chemistry that goes on in an aqueous environment.
It is hard to imagine what the world would be like if the H20 mole-
cule, like the CO2 molecule, had its parts arranged in a straight line;
probably we wouldn't be here to observe it. We hasten to add that
the shape of the H20 molecule is not a capricious whim of Nature.
Quantum mechanics has revealed clearly why a molecule made of
an eight-electron atom joined to two one-electron atoms must prefer
to be bent.

The behavior of a polar substance as a dielectric is strikingly different
from that of material composed of nonpolar molecules. The
dielectric constant of water is about 80, that of methyl alcohol 33,
while a typical nonpolar liquid might have a dielectric constant
around 2. In a nonpolar substance the application of an electric field
induces a slight dipole moment in each molecule. In the polar substance
dipoles are already present in great strength but, in the
absence of a field, are pointing in random directions so that they have
no large-scale effect. An applied electric field merely aligns them to
a certain degree. In either process, however, the macroscopic elfects
will be determined by the net amount of polarization per unit volume.

9.8 The Electric Field Caused by Polarized Matter

Suppose we build up a block of matter by assembling a very large
number of molecules in a previously empty region of space. Suppose
too that each of these molecules is polarized in the same direction.
For the present we need not concern ourselves with the nature of the
molecules or with the means by which their polarization is main-
tained. We are interested only in the electric field they produce when
they are in this condition; later we can introduce any fields from other
sources that might be around. If you like, you can imagine that these
are molecules with permanent dipole moments that have been lined
up neatly and frozen in position. All we need to specify is N, the
number of dipoles per cubic centimeter, and the moment of each
dipole p. We shall assume that N is so large that any macroscopically

% p. 317
small volume do contains quite a large number of dipoles. The total
dipole strength in such a volume is pN dv. At any point far away
from this volume element compared to its size, the electric field from
these particular dipoles will be practically the same if they were replaced
by a single dipole moment of strength pN do. We shall call pN
the density of polarization, and denote it by P, a vector quantity with
the dimensions charge-cm/cm3, or charge/cm2. Then Pdv is the
dipole moment to be associated with any small volume element do
for the purpose of computing the electric field at a distance. By the
way, our matter has been assembled from neutral molecules only;
there is no net charge in the system or on any molecule, so we have
only the dipole moments to consider as sources of a distant field.

In Fig. 9 .17 there is shown a slender column, or cylinder, of this
polarized material. Its cross section is da, and it extends vertically
from zl to Z2. The polarization density P within the column is uniform
over the length and points in the positive z direction. We are
about to calculate the electrical potential, at some external point, of
this column of polarization. An element of the cylinder, of height dz,
has a dipole moment P do = Pda dz. Its contribution to the potential
at the point A can be written down by referring back to our
formula Eq. 12 for the potential of a dipole.

51% =  9 (27)

The potential due to the entire column is

Z'' i (23)

¢A :  21 T2

This is simpler than it looks: dz cos 0 is just  --- dr, so that the inte-
grand is a perfect differential, d(l /r). The result of the integration is
then

«pl --- =Pda(i --- i) (29)
T2 71

Equation 29 is precisely the same as the expression for the potential
at A that would be produced by two point charges, a positive
charge of magnitude P da sitting on top of the column at a distance 12
from A, and a negative charge of the same magnitude at the bottom
of the column. The source consisting of a column of uniformly
polarized matter is equivalent, at least so far as its field at all external
points is concerned, to two concentrated charges.

 

 

% p. 318
We can prove this rigorously in another way without any mathe-
matics. Consider a small section of the column of height dz, containing
dipole moment in amount Pda dz. Let us make an irnita-
tion or substitute for this by taking an unpolarized insulator of the
same size and shape and sticking a charge +P da on top of it, and a
charge  --- Pda on the bottom. This little block now has the same
dipole moment as that bit of our original column, and therefore it
will make an identical contribution to the field at any remote point A.
(The field inside our substitute, or very close to it, may be different
from the field of the original --- we don't care about that.) Now make
a whole set of such blocks and stack them up to imitate the polarized
column. They must give the same field at A as the whole column
does, for each block gave the same contribution as its counterpart
in the original (Fig. 9.17b). Now see what we have! At every joint
the positive charge on the top of one block coincides with the negative
charge on the bottom of the block above it, making charge zero.
The only charges left uncompensated are the negative charge  --- P da
on the bottom of the bottom block and the positive charge +P da on
the top of the top block. Seen from a distant point such as A, these
look like point charges. We conclude, as before, that two such
charges produce at A exactly the same field as does our whole column
of polarized material.

With no further calculation we can extend this to a slab, or right
cylinder, of any proportions uniformly polarized in a direction perpendicular
to its parallel faces (Fig. 9.18a). The slab can simply be
subdivided into a bundle of columns and the potential outside will
be the sum of the contributions of the columns, each of which can
be replaced by a charge at either end. The charges on the top. P da
on each column end of area da, make up a uniform sheet of surface
charge of density a = P esu per unit area. We conclude that the
potential everywhere outside a uniformly polarized slab or cylinder
is precisely what would result from two sheets of surface charge
located where the top and bottom surfaces of the slab were located,
carrying the constant surface charge density 0 = +P and o :  --- P
respectively (Fig. 9.1819).

We are not quite ready to say anything about the field inside the
slab. However, we do know the potential at all points on the surface
of the slab, top, bottom, or sides. Any two such points, A and B,
can be connected by a path running entirely through the external
field, so that the line integral fE - ds is entirely determined by the
external field. It must be the same as the integral along the path A'B'

% p. 319
in Fig. 9.1819. A point literally on the surface of the dielectric might
be within range of the intense molecular fields, the ``near field'' of
the molecule that we have left out of account. Let's agree to define
the boundary of the dielectric as a surface far enough out from the
outermost atomic nucleus --- l0 or 20 angstroms would be margin
enough --- so that at any point outside this boundary, the ``near fields''
of the individual atoms make a negligible contribution to the whole
line integral from A to B.

With this in mind, let's look at a rather thin, wide plate of polarized
material, of thickness t shown in cross section in Fig. 9.l9a. Figure
9.1919 shows, likewise in cross section, the equivalent sheets of charge.
For the system of two charge sheets we know the field, of course, in
the space both outside and between the sheets. The field strength
inside, well away from the edges, must be just 4770, pointing down,
and the potential difi‘erence between points A' and B' is therefore
47mt statvolts. The same potential difierence must exist between

corresponding points A and B on our polarized slab, because the
entire external field is the same in the two systems.

Is the field identical inside, too? Certainly not, because the slab
is full of positive nuclei and electrons, with fields of millions of volts
per centimeter pointing in one direction here, another direction there.
But one thing is the same: The line integral of the field, reckoned over
any internal path from A to B, must be just (P3  ---  <pA, which as we have
seen is the same as (pg:  ---  <pA«, which is equal to 47rot, or 47rPt. This
must be so because the introduction of atomic charges, no matter
what their distribution, cannot destroy the conservative property of

the electric field, expressed in the statement that j'E- ds is independent
of path, or curl E = 0.

 

% p. 320
 
 

We know that in Fig. 9.1919 the potential difference between the
top and bottom sheets is nearly constant, except near the edges, because
the interior electric field is practically uniform. Therefore in
the central area of our polarized plate the potential difierence between
top and bottom must likewise be constant. In this region the

line integralLBE - ds taken from any point A on top of the slab to

any point B on the bottom, by any path, must always yield the same
value 477-Pt. Figure 9.20 is a ``magnified view'' of the central region
of the slab, in which the polarized molecules have been made to look
something like H20 molecules all pointing the same way. We have
not attempted to depict the very intense fields that exist between the
molecules, and inside them. (Ten angstroms distant from a water
molecule its field amounts to several hundred kilovolts/cm, as you
can discover from Table 9.1 and Eq. 14.) You must imagine some
rather complicated field configurations in the neighborhood of each
molecule. Now the E that stands in j'E - ds means the total electric
field at a given point in space, inside or outside a molecule; it includes
these complicated and intense fields just mentioned. We
have reached the remarkable conclusion that any path through this
welter of charges and fields, whether it dodges molecules or penetrates
them, must yield the same value for the path integral, namely
the value we find in the system of Fig. 9.1919 where the field is quite
uniform and has the strength 47rP.

This tells us that the spatial average of the electric field within our
polarized slab must be  --- 47rP. By the spatial average of a field E

over some volume V, which we might denote by (E) V, we mean
precisely this:

(E)V=%jVEdv (30)

One way to sample impartially the field in many equal small dv's
into which V might be divided would be to measure the field along
each line in a ``fiber bundle'' of closely spaced parallel lines. We
have just seen that the line integral of E along any or all such paths
is the same as if we were in a constant electric field of strength  ---  47rP.
That is the justification for the conclusion that (E) =  --- 47rP.

This average field is a macroscopic quantity. The volume over
which we take the average should be large enough to include very
many molecules, otherwise the average will fluctuate from one such
volume to the adjoining one. The average field (E) defined by Eq. 30
is really the only kind of macroscopic electric field in the interior of

% p. 321
a dielectric that we can talk about. It provides the only satisfactory
answer, in the context of a macroscopic description of matter, to the
question, ``What is the electric field inside a dielectric material?''

The E in the integrand on the right, in Eq. 30, we may call the
microscopic field. If we send someone out to measure the field values
we need for the path integral, he will be measuring electric fields in
vacuum, in the presence, of course, of electric charge. He will need
very tiny instruments, for he may be called on to measure the field
at a particular point just inside one end of a certain molecule. Have
we any right to talk in this way about taking the line integral of E
along some path that skirts the southwest corner of a particular
molecule and then tunnels through its neighbor? Yes. The justification
is the massive evidence that the laws of electromagnetism work
down to a scale of distances much smaller than atomic size. We can
even describe an experiment which would serve to measure the
average of the microscopic electric field along a path defined well
within the limits of atomic dimensions. All we have to do is shoot
an energetic charged particle, an alpha particle for example, through
the material. From the net change in its momentum the average
electric field that acted on it, over its whole path, could be inferred.

Let's work a numerical example involving polarized material.
Imagine a disk 1 cm in radius and 0.3 cm thick, as in Fig. 9.2la. Let
the density of molecules in the disk be 3 )< 1022 molecules/cm3.
Suppose they are all polar molecules, each with a dipole moment
1.8 X l0‘13 esu-cm. Finally --- and this is a rather far-fetched
assumption --- suppose they are all lined up, like the molecules in
Fig. 9.20, with their dipole moments pointing in the same direction,
parallel to the axis of the disk. We'll discuss the field at a point A
inside the disk, a point B just outside the disk, and a point C 10 cm
away on the axis. The polarization P has the value

P = Np = (3 x 1022 cm‘3) X (1.8 X 10-13 esu-cm)
= 5.4 x 104 esu/cm? (31)

The equivalent sheets of charge are shown in Fig. 9.2lc. If these
sheets extended to infinity, the field at the point A between them
would be simply 4770, or 6.8 X 105 statvolts/cm. That will be a
pretty good approximation in this case, because the separation of
the sheets is relatively small compared to their diameter. Actually,
the field will be slightly less. The field just outside, at point B, would
be zero for infinite sheets, but in the actual case will have a relatively
small value, pointing to the right. The discontinuity in E at the posi-

% p. 322
tive sheet will be exactly 47m, or 47rP. If we needed to calculate the
fields at A or B precisely, we could use the formula we worked out
in Chap. 2 for the field of a disk of surface charge, superposing the
fields of two such disks appropriately located. To estimate the field
at a remote point hke C, all we need to know is the total dipole
moment of the object. Seen from C, it doesn't matter much how the
individual dipoles are distributed. The disk acts like a single dipole
of strength pm, = volume x P = 0.942 cm3 X 5.4 x 104 esu/cm? :
5.1 )< 104 esu-cm. The field on the axis of such a dipole, 10 cm
away, is

E0 = 2Ptot _ 10.2 X 104 esu-cm

13 _ (10 Cm)3 = 102 statvolts/cm (32)

9.9 The Capacitor Filled with Dielectric

We have been a long time getting around to the dielectric-filled
capacitor, but now we can bring to bear on this problem some understanding
of the dielectric itself. Consider first the two conducting
plates in vacuum with charge  --- Q on the upper plate, charge +Q
on the lower. Figure 9.22:1 is just Fig. 9.1a, with which we began
this chapter, in cross section. The field between the plates E0 is
equal to 47rQ/A, and points upward. The potential difference between
the plates, (p12, is equal to 47rQt/A. The capacitance of the
empty capacitor, C0, is given by the now familiar formula

C0 = % = 4177, <33)

Now bring between the plates a dielectric. The field will polarize
the atoms or molecules in the dielectric. We cannot, at this stage,
predict the magnitude of the induced dipole moment of each molecule
because the field that acts on the molecule in this situation is
not just the field E0 but includes a contribution from the other molecules
as well. The direction of the polarization, at any rate, will be
parallel to E0, for a dielectric that is isotropic. Let us denote the
magnitude of the polarization density, whatever it may be, by P.
We now have the system shown in Fig. 9.220, consisting of two real
sheets of charge plus a slab of polarized material. It is the superposition
of the two charge distributions we have already analyzed.
that of Fig. 9.22a, and that of Fig. 9.19:1, shown again in Fig. 9.2219.
The electric field will be the sum of the fields of those two distribu-
tions, the field E0 of two real charge sheets of surface charge density

% p. 323
0 = Q/A. plus the field E' of the two charge sheets of density a' = P,
to which the polarized slab is equivalent. Notice that E' is directed
opposite to E0 because P is in the same direction as E0; the sheet of
positive equivalent charge lies next to the negatively charged plate.
The reason for this, of course, is that the negative charge on the plate
polarized the atoms of the dielectric by pulling on their positive parts
and pushing on their negative parts, thus drawing positive charge

closer to that plate. In the interior of the capacitor, then, the electric
field E is

E=Eo+E'=E0 --- 4vrP (34)

The magnitude of the potential difference between the plates has
become

The charge on the capacitor is still the same. If the plates were to
be connected by a wire, the charge Q would drain oil'', the dielectric
meanwhile relaxing back to its unpolarized condition. Because the
potential difference has been reduced by the factor (E0  ---  47rP)/E0,
as compared to the vacuum capacitor with the same charge, the

capacitance, C = Q/(pm, has been increased by the reciprocal of that
factor:

E0

CZCOKTJ

(36)
It is better to express this in terms of E, the electric field (macro-
scopic. or average, field) that now exists within the capacitor. Since
E0 = E + 47rP, from Eq. 34, we have

C=C0 :C0<l+4'/7%) (37)

The ratio of P to E is an intrinsic property of the dielectric material.
This ratio is called the electric susceptibility of the material, and the
symbol X9 is customarily used for it. The ratio is dimensionless.

The entire quantity in parenthesis in Eq. 37 is called the dielectric
constant of the material denoted by e.

P : xeE e = l + 47rxe (38)

These are just definitions; the physics is in Eqs. 34 and 37.
Strictly speaking, filling the vacuum capacitor with dielectric material
increases the capacitance by precisely the factor 6 only if we

% p. 324
fill the space all around it as well as the space between the plates.
In the example above we have tacitly assumed that the plate separation
t is so small compared to the width of the plates that ``edge
effects,'' including the small amount of charge that is on the outside
of the plates near the edge (see Fig. 3.1119) are negligible. A quite
general statement can be made about a system of conductors of any
shape or arrangement which is entirely immersed in a homogeneous,
isotropic dielectric --- for instance in a large tank of oil. With any
charges whatever, Q1, Q2, etc., on the various conductors, the macroscopic
field Emed everywhere in the dielectric medium is just 1/: times
the field Ema that would exist there with the same charges on the
same conductors in vacuum (Fig. 9.23). Of course all potential
differences are reduced by the same factor, 1/6.

Our unfinished business consists of two problems of a quite different
nature:

(i) We need to understand the behavior of any system of insulators
and conductors, given the dielectric constants of the
materials involved. That is, we want to be able to calculate
the electric fields outside the dielectrics and the macroscopic
E inside, whatever boundary conditions are imposed
in terms of potentials and charges on the conductors.

(ii) The quantitative relation between the bulk polarizability of
a material, expressed by the susceptibility X6, and the polar-
izability of the atoms or molecules of which the dielectric
is composed, remains rather mysterious. To discover it
we shall have to decide what field a polarizable atom
actually feels when the space average, or macroscopic, field
in its vicinity is known. What a fixed atom feels is not the
space average field, but another field we can call the local
field. It is the local field, Em, that actually induces the
dipole moment of the atom. This question calls for another
``microscopic'' look at the interior of the dielectric.

We turn first to problem (i).

9.10 The Field of a Polarized Sphere

The solid sphere in Fig, 9.24a is supposed to be uniformly polar-
ized, as if it had been carved out of the substance of the slab in
Fig. 9.18a. What must the electric field be like, both inside and outside
the sphere? This is an instructive problem, and the results will
be useful in other ways. P as usual will denote the density of polar-

% p. 325
ization, constant in magnitude and direction throughout the volume
of the sphere. The polarized material could be divided, like the slab
in Fig. 9.l8a, into columns parallel to P, and each of these replaced
by a charge of magnitude (P )< column cross section) at top and
bottom. Thus the field we seek is that of a surface charge distribution
spread over a sphere with density a = P cos 0. The factor cos 0
enters, as should be obvious from the figure, because a column of
cross section da intercepts on the sphere a patch of surface of area
da/cos 0. Figure 9.2419 is a cross section through this shell of equivalent
surface charge in which the density of charge has been indicated
by the varying thickness of the black semicircle above (positive
charge density) and the light semicircle below (negative charge
density).

If it has not already occurred to you, this figure may suggest that
we think of the polarization P as having arisen from the slight upward
displacement of a ball filled uniformly with positive charge of
volume density p, relative to a ball of negative charge of density  --- p.
That would leave uncompensated positive charge poking out at the
top and negative charge showing at the bottom, varying in amount
precisely as cos 0 over the whole boundary. In the interior, where
the positive and negative charge densities still overlap, they would

exactly cancel one another. Taking this view, we see a very easy way
to calculate the field outside the shell of surface charge. Any
spherical charge distribution, as we know, has an external field the
same as if its entire charge were concentrated at the center. So the
superposition of two spheres of total charge +Q and  --- Q respec-
tively, with their centers separated by a small displacement s, will
produce an external field the same as that of two point charges Q and
 ---  Q, s cm apart. That is just a dipole with dipole moment pa = Q3.

A microscopic description of the polarized substance leads us to
the same conclusion. In Fig. 9.25a the molecular dipoles actually
responsible for the polarization P have been crudely represented as
consisting individually of a pair of charges q and  --- q, s cm apart, to
make a dipole moment p = qs. With N of these per cubic centi-
meter, P = Np = Nqs, and the total number of such dipoles in the
sphere is (471/3)r03N. The positive charges, considered separately
(Fig. 9.25b), are distributed throughout a sphere with total charge
content Q = (47r/3)ro3Nq, and the negative charges occupy a similar
sphere with its center displaced (Fig. 9.250). Clearly each of these
charge distributions can be replaced by a point charge at its center,
if we are concerned with the field well outside the distribution. ``Well
outside'' means far enough away from the surface so that the actual

% p. 327
graininess of the charge distribution doesn't matter, and of course
that is something we always have to ignore when we speak of the
macroscopic fields. So for present purposes the picture of overlapping
spheres of uniform charge density and the description in
terms of actual dipoles in a vacuum are equivalent,T and show that
the field outside the distribution is the same as that of a single dipole
located at the center. The moment of this dipole pg is simply the
total polarization in the sphere:

po = Q3 = 43lr.,3Nqs = 4 --- 3''r03P (39)
The quantities Q and s have, separately, no significance and may
now be dropped from the discussion.

The external field of the polarized sphere is that of a central
dipole P0, not only at a great distance from the sphere; it is the pure
dipole field right down to the surface, macroscopically speaking.
All we had to do to construct Fig. 9.26, a representation of the external
field lines, was to block out a circular area from Fig. 9.5.

The internal field is a different matter. Let's look at the electric
potential, q>(x,y,z). We know the potential at all points on the
spherical boundary because we know the external field. It is just
the dipole potential, pg cos 0/r2, which on the spherical boundary of
radius ro becomes

(p : po cjosza = 4T7TPT0 COS 0 

Since ro cos 0 = z, we see that the potential of a point on the sphere
depends only on its z coordinate:

q) = 4?'' Pz (41)

The problem of finding the internal field has boiled down to this:
Equation 41 gives the potential at every point on the boundary of
the region, inside which qa must satisfy Laplace's equation. Accord-
ing to the Uniqueness Theorem we proved in Chap. 3, that suffices
to determine (p throughout the interior. If we can find a solution,
it must be the solution. Now the function Cz, where C is any con-
stant, satisfies Laplace's equation, so Eq. 41 has actually handed us

TThis may have been obvious enough, but we have labored the details in this one
case to allay any suspicion that the ``smooth-charge-ball'' picture, which is so different

from what we know the interior of a real substance to be like, might be leading us
astray.

the solution to the otential in the interior of the s here. It is the

potential of a uniform electric field in the  --- z direction:

Bqam 8 [47rPz] 47rP
E2 2  ---  T Z  ---   ---  :  ---  ---  -

As the direction of P was the only thinghthat distinguished the z axis,
we can write our result in more general form:

Em =  ---  4% (43)
This is the macroscopic field E in the polarized material.

Figure 9.27 shows both the internal and external field. At the
upper pole of the sphere, the strength of the upward-pointing external
field is, from Eq. 14 for the field of a dipole,

Zpo _ 2(47rro3P/3) _ 8'n'P

E2 =  --- 13 ---  T 3 (outside) (44)

which is just twice the magnitude of the downward --- pointing internal
field.

This example illustrates the general rules for the behavior of the
field components at the surface of a polarized medium. E is discontinuous
at the boundary of a polarized medium exactly as it
would be at a surface in vacuum which carried a surface charge
density a = P''. The symbol P,, stands for the component of P
normal to the surface outward. It follows that the normal component
of E must change abruptly by an amount 4'/'rP,,, while the
component of E parallel to the boundary remains continuous, that
is, has the same value on both sides of the boundary. Indeed, at the
north pole of our sphere the net change in E, is 8771'/3  ---  ( --- -47rP/ 3)
or 47rP. Referring to Eq. 14 for the dipole field, you can check that
the component of E parallel to the surface is continuous from inside
to outside everywhere on the sphere.

None of these conclusions depends on how the polarization of
the sphere was caused. Assuming any sphere is uniformly polarized,
Fig. 9.27 shows its field. Onto this can be superposed any field from
other sources, thus representing many possible systems. This will
not affect the discontinuity in E at the boundary of the polarized
medium. The rules just stated therefore apply in any system, the
discontinuity in E being determined solely by the existing polar-
ization.

9.11 A Dielectric Sphere in a Uniform Field

As an example, let us put a sphere of dielectric material characterized
by a dielectric constant 5 into a homogeneous electric field E0
like the field between the parallel plates of a vacuum capacitor,
Fig. 9.28. Let the sources of this field, the charges on the plates,
be far from the sphere so that they do not shift as the sphere is intro-
duced. Then whatever the field may be in the vicinity of the sphere,
it will remain practically E0 at a great distance. That is what is meant
by putting a sphere into a uniform field. The total field E is no
longer uniform in the neighborhood of the sphere. It is the sum of
the uniform field E0 of the distant sources and a field E' generated
by the polarized matter itself:

E = E0 + E' (45)

The field E' depends on the polarization P of the dielectric, which in
turn depends on the value of E inside the sphere:

1>=X.E=‘ --- 1E (46)
477

We don't know yet what the total field E is; we only know that
Eq. 46 has to hold at any point inside the sphere. If the sphere becomes
uniformly polarized, an assumption that will need to be
justified by our results, the relation between the polarization of the
sphere and its own field E', at points inside, is given already by Eq. 43.
(In Eq. 43 we were using the symbol E for this field; in that case it

was the only field present.)

E{,, = _ ‘ll (47)
3
Now we have enough equations to eliminate P and E', which should

give us a relation connecting E and E0. Using Eqs. 45 to 47 we find:

E=E0_LP=E0_‘"1E (48)
3 3
Solving for E,
_ 3
E~<...>Eo 

Because 5 is greater than one, the factor 3/ (2 + 6) will be less than

one; the field inside the dielectric is weaker than E0. The polarization
is

P=‘ --- ‘E=i(``1)E{, (50)

% p. 330
The assumption of uniform polarization is now seen to be self-
consistentq`` To compute the total field E outside the sphere we must
add Vectorially to E0 the field of a central dipole with dipole moment
equal to P times the volume of the sphere. Some field lines of E,
both inside and outside the dielectric sphere, are shown in Fig. 9.29.

9.12 The Field of a Charge in a Dielectric Medium, and
Gauss's Law

Suppose that a very large volume of homogeneous dielectric has
somewhere within it a concentrated charge Q, not part of the regular
molecular structure of the dielectric. Imagine, for instance, that a
small metal sphere has been charged and then dropped into a tank
of oil. As was stated earlier, the electric field in the oil is simply 1/:
times the field that Q would produce in a vacuum.

E = Q2 (51)
61'

It is interesting to see how Gauss's law works out. The surface integral
of E (which is the macroscopic, or space average, field, remem-
ber) taken over a sphere surrounding Q, gives 47rQ/c, if we believe
Eq. 51, and not 47rQ. Why not? The answer is that Q is not the only
charge inside the sphere. There are also all the charges that make up
the atoms and molecules of the dielectric. Ordinarily any volume
of the oil would be electrically neutral. But now the oil is radially
polarized, which means that the charge Q, assuming it is positive, has
pulled in toward itself the negative charge in the oil molecules and
pushed away the positive charges. Although the displacement may
be only very slight in each molecule, still on the average any sphere
we draw around Q will contain more oil --- molecule negative charge
than oil --- molecule positive charge. Hence the net charge in the
sphere, including the ``foreign'' charge Q at the center, is less than Q.

In fact it is Q/6.
It is often useful to distinguish between the ``foreign'' charge Q
and the charges that make up the dielectric itself. Over the former

]‘That is what makes this system easy to deal with. For a dielectric cylinder of
finite length in a uniform electric field, the assumption would not work. The field E'
of a uniformly polarized cylinder --- for instance one with its length about equal to its
diameter --- is not uniform inside the cylinder. (What must it look like?) Therefore
E = E0 + E' cannot be uniform --- but in that case P : xeE could not be uniform after
all. In fact it is only dielectrics of ellipsoidal shape, of which the sphere is a special
case, which acquire uniform polarization in a uniform field.

% p. 331
we have some degree of control --- charge can be added to or removed
from an object, such as the plate of a capacitor. This is often called
free charge. The other charges, which are integral parts of the atoms
or molecules of the dielectric, are usually called ``bound'' charge.
Structural charge might be a better name. These charges are not
mobile but more or less elastically bound, contributing, by their
slight displacement, to the polarization.

One can devise a vector quantity which is related by something
like Gauss's law to the free charge only. In the system we have just
examined, a point charge Q immersed in a dielectric, the vector (E
has this property. That is, feE - da, taken over some closed surface S,
equals 47rQ if S encloses Q, and zero if it does not. By superposition,
this must hold for any collection of free charges described by a free
charge density pf,ee(x,y,z) in an infinite homogeneous dielectric
medium:

fser:-da = 477 fvpfmdu (52)

where V is the volume enclosed by the surface S. An integral relation
like this implies a ``local'' relation between the divergence of
the vector field eE and the free charge density:

div (‘E) = 4'77Pfree 

Since 5 has been assumed to be constant throughout the medium,
Eq. 53 tells us nothing new. However it can help us to isolate the
role of the bound charge. In any system whatever, the fundamental
relation between electric field E and total charge density pfree + pbmmd
remains valid:

diV E = 47T(Ptree + Pbound) (54)
From Eqs. 53 and 54 it follows that
diV (5  ---  1)E =  --- 4'7TPbound (55)
According to Eq. 38, (£  ---  l)E = 477'P, so Eq. 55 implies that
div 1' =  --- Pbound (56)

Equation 56 is a statement about two aspects of the bound charge
distribution in any neighborhood, and about nothing else. There-
fore it cannot depend on conditions elsewhere in the system, nor
on how the particular arrangement of bound charges is maintained.
Any arrangement of bound charge which has a certain local excess,

% p. 332
per unit volume, of nuclear protons over atomic electrons must
represent a polarization with a certain divergence. So Eq. 56 must
hold universally, not just in the unbounded dielectric. You can get
a feeling for the identity expressed in Eq. 56 by imagining a few polar
molecules arranged to give a polarization with a positive divergence
(Fig. 9.30). The dipoles point outward, which necessarily leaves a
little concentration of negative charge in the middle. Of course,
Eq. 56 refers to averages over volume elements so large that P and
pbmmd can be treated as smoothly varying quantities.
From Eqs. 54 and 56 we get the relation

div (E + 4711') = 47rpf,ee (57)

This is quite independent of any relation between E and P. It is not
limited to those materials, which we call dielectrics, in which P is
proportional to E.

It is customary to give the combination E + 4771' a special name,

the electric displacement vector, and its own symbol, D. That is. we
define D by

D = E + 47rP (58)
In an isotropic dielectric, D is simply cE, but the relation
div D :_ 4‘7Tpf1-ee (59)

holds in any situation in which the macroscopic quantities P, E, and
p can be defined.

The appearance of Eq. 59 may suggest that we should look on D
as a vector field whose source is the free charge distribution pf]-ee, in
the same sense that the total charge distribution p is the source of E.
That would be wrong. The electrostatic field E is uniquely determined
--- except for the addition of a constant field --- by the charge
distribution p because, supplementing the law div E : 477p, there
is another universal condition, curl E = 0. It is not true. in general.
that curl D = 0. Thus the distribution of free charge is not sufficient
to determine D through Eq. 59. Something else is needed, such as
the boundary conditions at various dielectric surfaces. The boundary
conditions on D are of course merely an alternate way of expressing
the boundary conditions involving E and P, already stated near
the end of Sec. 9.10.

In the approach we have taken to electric fields in matter the introduction
of D is an artifice which is not, on the whole, very helpful.
We have mentioned D because it is hallowed by tradition, beginning

% p. 333
with Maxwellq‘ and the student is sure to encounter it in other books,
many of which treat it with more respect than it deserves.

Our essential conclusions about electric fields in matter can be
summarized like this:

(i) Matter can be polarized, its condition being described com-
pletely, so far as the macroscopic field is concerned, by a
polarization density P, which is the dipole moment per unit
volume. The contribution of such matter to the electric
field E is the same as that of a charge distribution pbound,
existing in vacuum and having the density pbound =  --- div P.
In particular, at the surface of a polarized substance, where
there is a discontinuity in P, this reduces to a surface charge
of density 0 =  --- P,,. Add any free charge distribution that
may be present, and the electric field is the field that this
total charge distribution would produce in vacuum. That
is the macroscopic field E both inside and outside matter,
with the understanding that inside matter it is the spatial
average of the true microscopic field.

(ii) If P is proportional to E in a material, we call the material
a dielectric. We define the electric susceptibility X5 and the
dielectric constant a characteristic of that material:
X3 : P/E and e = l + 47rx,,. Free charges immersed in
a dielectric give rise to electric fields which are l/e times
as strong as the same charges would produce in vacuum.

9.13 The Connection between Electric Susceptibility and
Atomic Polarizability

The ratio of polarization density P to macroscopic electric field E
in a substance is the electric susceptibility Xe. Suppose the substance
is composed of atoms of atomic polarizability 01. Now P is nothing
but the sum, in unit volume, of the dipole moments p of the individual
atoms. We can predict the induced dipole moment of an atom if
we know at and the electric field acting on the atom to polarize it.
Hence we ought to be able, if we know at and the number of atoms

TThe prominence of D in Maxwell's formulation of electromagnetic theory. and his
choice of the name displacement can perhaps be traced to his inclination toward a
kind of mechanical model of the ``aether.'' Whittaker has pointed out in his classic,
A History of the Theories of Aether and Electricity, Vol. I, p. 266 (Harper Torchbooks,
New York, 1960) that this inclination may have led Maxwell himself astray at one
point in the application of his theory ofthe problem ofreflection oflight from a dielectric.

% p. 334
 
 

 

per unit volume, N, to predict the susceptibility Xe. Let us try to
make a theory connecting Xe with at.

The dipole moment induced in some atom A is determined by the
field, arising from all other sources, that acts on that atom. This is
not the same as the macroscopic electric field E in that neighborhood,
for that field E includes a contribution from the charges in the atom A
itself. So our problem takes an interesting twist right at the begin-
ning. To make the situation clear, we consider a very specific system.
Our substance is made of identical atoms arrayed on a simple cubic
crystal lattice with spacing 12 cm between nearest neighbors. The
polarizability of each atom is 01. Figure 9.31 is a cross section
through the lattice. The assumed direction of the macroscopic field
E in that region is indicated, as is the distortion of the polarized
atoms. Our question is, what is the magnitude of the field that is
causing that distortion? Each atom may be thought of as occupying
its own cubical box, and we shall assume that the atoms are a good
deal smaller than the lattice spacing, so that all the charge in an atom
is fairly near the center of its box.

We'll designate by Eelse the field that acts on atom A. The sources
of this field are everything else in the system, including all the other
atoms and any other charges outside. E9159 is the field that we would
find in box A if we could magically remove atom A while freezing all
other charge distributions in the shape they have with atom A
present. Eelse will not be quite constant through box A, but we shall
suppose that its average value within the box is close enough to what
we want. By an average over the volume enclosed by box A we

mean, as usual, the integral I E do divided by the volume of the box.

We shall indicate such averages by ( )1,,,x.

Let Esau denote the field of the atom A. The total microscopic
field, Emic, is then at every point

Emic = Eelse ‘l' Eself 

We know that the macroscopic field E is equal to the space average
of the microscopic field Emic. The variation of Emic is of course the
same in every box. Also, the boxes completely fill the space with
no gaps between them. Therefore the average of Emic within any
one box must be the same as its average over a larger region containing
many boxes.T It follows that

<Emic>box = E 

'rDon't accept this crucial statement without thought. Why would gaps between
boxes spoil it?

% p. 335
But (E,,,ic)bo,, = (Ee1s,,)b.,x + (Eseu)b.,x, the average of a sum being
the sum of the averages, so that (Ee1se)b,,x, which is the quantity we're
after, is given by

<Eelse> box = E `` <Eself> box 

Our problem is now reduced to the calculation of (Ese1;)box, the

average within the box of the field of the atom which occupies the
box.

<Ese1f>box = % Ibex Eself dv 

We must include in the integration all volume elements within the
box, inside as well as outside the atomic charge distribution. Figure
9.32 suggests what the field E591; might look like. It makes our task
seem formidable. However, we can always deal with a charge distribution
one element at a time. Let us calculate the box average
of the field Eq from a single point charge q.

If the point charge were at the center of the box, as in Fig. 9.33a,

the integral Eq do would be zero. Thanks to the symmetry,

box

every volume element in the box is matched by another in which the
field has equal strength in the opposite direction. Now shift the
charge q upward by a small distance z, as in Fig. 9.331). There is a
thin layer at the bottom of the box, of thickness 2z, that is not bal-

 

% p. 336
anced by a layer at the top. It is this layer which now makes the only
contribution to box Eq dv. Obviously, we only need to compute the

average of Eqz; Eqz and Eqy will still average to zero. If we neglect the
slight variation of Eqz in the thickness of the layer, the volume integral
of Eqz through the volume of the layer is just 2z times the sur-

face integral of Eqz over the square which forms the median plane
of the layer (Fig. 9.33c).

jam E,'' dv = 2; We Eqz da (64)

Gauss's law comes to our aid now, for the surface integral in Eq. 64
is just the flux of Eq through one side of a cube centered about the
charge q. That flux must be just 4a7q/ 6, because a cube has six equiv-

alent faces. We conclude that 2z j E,,, da =  --- 2z(4'77q/6) =

square

 ---  47rqz/3 so that

1 -4:
aana=3§,``maw= 3;' mm

The minus sign expresses the fact that upward displacement of a
positive charge results in a preponderance of downward field in the
box. A similar formula would apply to a displacement in the x or
the y direction. Therefore a small displacement r from the center in
any direction will result in the average field in the box being
 --- 47rqr/3b3. Hence for our complete atom A, with its charge distribution
p(x,y,z), the average field in the box will be

<amm=;gfmw mm
In the integral f rp do we can recognize the dipole moment of the

charge distribution, p. (Compare the definition of dipole moment,
Eq. 10.) We have now

<Ese1f>b0x =  P 
The rest is clear sailing. From Eq. 62 we get at once:
<Eelse>box = E "  

If we say that (Ee1Se)b.,x is the field effective in polarizing the atom,
then p is related to this field through the atomic polarizability:

/‘l‘| \ //r\\

% p. 337
From Eqs. 68 and 69 we get the relation connecting p and E:

p=a[E+4'''P] (70)

This can be written in terms of the macroscopic polarization density
P. Since N, the number of polarized atoms per cubic centimeter, is
equal to 1/I93, P = Np = p/b3. Substituting in Eq. 70,

P=Na[E+‘l'''TP] (71)
which, rearranged, is
_ Na
P ‘ l1  ---  (477/3)Na]E (72)

The factor in brackets must be the electric susceptibility Xe.

We made two approximations along the way to Eq. 72. We assumed
that all parts of the atomic charge distribution are near the
center of the box; Eqs. 65 and 66 are not accurate if z, or r, is not
small compared to b. Also, we used the average of Eelse in the box,
instead of the value of E9159 at the center of the box, as the field that
polarizes the atom. For atoms packed as close together as they are
in most crystals, the first assumption is not very realistic, and the
question involved in the second assumption is irrelevant. We can't
expect Eq. 72 to be obeyed exactly by a real crystal.

If the atoms of a substance are very far apart, so that 4vrNa/3 < l,

we can neglect that term in the denominator in Eq. 72, which leaves
us with

X9 = Na (73)

That is the result we would have obtained if we had forgotten about
the influence of the dipoles on one another. It applies quite well to
gases at normal density, for which the neglected term is of the order
of 10-3. In that limit the geometrical arrangement of the atoms
doesn't matter, only the. number per cubic centimeter. Thus by
measuring accurately the dielectric constant of a low-pressure gas,
the atomic polarizability can be determined without any complications
from mutual influence of the dipoles. Measurements on a

denser form of the same substance'r can then be used to test a theoretical
formula such as Eq. 72.

Tlt can be shown that the relation given in Eq. 72 should hold not only for a crystal
with cubic symmetry but also for a gas in which the atoms occupy random positions in
space. The best experimental confirmation of this comes from measurements of the

,.I:,.l,......: A A A . a . a _ 4 7‘ at . . A . . _ . _..I-.:....I_. L.‘._L ..I..-.:... .._..l _ ...... _. 1...... n--I_ nnox

% p. 338
 
 

 

 

The term  --- 477Na/ 3 in the denominator of Eq. 72 reflects the interaction
of the polarized atoms in the crystal. Evidently the interaction
is in the nature of a reinforcement, leading to a larger polarization
than would exist without it. If we take the mathematical formula
seriously, it suggests a surprising possibility. What if Na should be
so large that 47rNa/3 would equal or exceed one? It appears that
Xe would go to infinity. That might mean a polarization in zero
applied field! It sounds like nonsense but it isn't entirely. Some
crystals are known which do show a spontaneous electric polariza-
tion. However, something more than induced polarization is involved
in that case, so our theory isn't applicable. In fact, to make
47rNa/3 approach one, the atoms have to be so close together that
our approximations are no good at all (see Prob. 9.30).

9.14 Energy Changes in Polarization

To charge a capacitor to a potential difference V, work amounting
to %CV2 has to be done. That amount of energy can be recovered
by allowing the capacitor to discharge through an external circuit.
The energy has been stored in the charged capacitor. It was shown
in Chap. 2 that in any electrostatic system the stored energy can be
calculated by assigning E2/8'/7 ergs/cm3 to the electric field. By way
of review, the field strength E in the parallel-plate vacuum capacitor,
of plate area A and separation t, is V/ t, so that (E2/877) x volume :
V2A/87rt = %CV2.

If the capacitor is filled with dielectric of dielectric constant c and
charged to the same potential difference V, the work done will be
greater by the factor £, because C is that much greater. However,
E is the same. Therefore the energy to be associated with unit
Volume in the dielectric is not E2/877, but (E2/8w. This can be generalized
to any electrostatic system. In place of Eq. 2.36 we have now:

Energy = T177 5E2 do (74)

How is the ``extra'' energy stored? Consider an isolated polar-
izable molecule, to which an electric field can be applied. In Fig. 9.34
the molecule is represented by two charges fastened to the ends of
an elastic spring. Its dipole moment p is a vector of magnitude qs.
The field E arises from some external source, such as the plates and
battery shown in the figure. Suppose that while the field E is present,

% p. 339
the charges move apart by an increment ds. The dipole moment
thereby changes from qs to q(s + ds). And there has been a motion
of charge in the direction of E, equivalent to charge +q moving distance
ds. (It doesn't matter whether one end moves, or both.)
Hence work in amount Eq ds has been done on the molecule. The
ultimate supplier of this work is the source of the field --- in Fig. 9.34
the battery that maintains constant potential difference between the
plates. If dW stands for the work done on the molecule, then

dW=Eqds:E-dp (75)

The stored energy that corresponds to this can be found in two
places, in the elastic spring which has been stretched to a greater
length, and in the electric field of the molecular dipole itself, which
now has more total energy because the two charges are farther apart.
In the case of a real molecule we should not make such a distinction.
It is all energy belonging to the molecular structure, and if we were
to look into that dynamic structure we should find the energy as
electrostatic potential energy and kinetic energy of electron motion.
The point is simply this: The work that has been done on the molecule
to change its polarization, E - dp, has increased by just that much
the energy tied up in the molecule itself.

Let us see how much of the energy stored in the dielectric can be
accounted for in this way. With N molecules per unit volume,
P = Np. When P changes by dP, then E - dP is the increase in internal
energy of the molecules in 1 cm3. But since P = (c  ---  l)E/47r,

E-dP : La _ 1)E-dE = Lg _ 1)d(E2) (76)
477 877'

Therefore, of the (E2/877 ergs which appear to be stored in the dielec-
tric, (c  ---  1)E2/877 can be accounted for as increased internal energy
of the polarized molecules. The remainder, E2/877, is just the energy
stored in the vacuum field.

9.15 Dielectrics Made of Polar Molecules

Molecules with permanent dipole moments, polar molecules,
respond to an electric field by trying to line up parallel to it. The
appropriate mechanical model is not two charges on the ends of a
spring, but two charges fastened to the ends of a stick (Fig. 9.35).
If the stick is not parallel to the field, there is a torque on it, of mag-

% p. 340
nitude Eqs sin 0. The work done in an angular displacement d6' is
(torque X angular displacement) or Eqs sin 0d0. This can also
be written in terms of the vector dipole moment p, which is a vector
of magnitude qs, and the change dp which occurs through rotation
by d0. From the diagram it is clear that the magnitude of dp is p d0,
and its direction is such that E - dp = E dp sin 0. Thus dW = E - dp.
This agrees with Eq. 75, as it ought to.

If an isolated polar molecule occupies the position indicated in
Fig. 9.35 at the instant the electric field E is switched on, it will swing
into line with the field, but then it will continue swinging past equilibrium
and will oscillate like a pendulum, for it has no way to get
rid of its energy. However, a real molecule surrounded by other
molecules can exchange energy with its neighbors, providing a kind
of ``friction'' that damps the oscillation. It would seem that this
might result in all the polar molecules in a substance settling down
exactly parallel to any applied field, however weak. So it would at
the temperature absolute zero, assuming rotation were still possible.
At any temperature above absolute zero the random motion of
thermal agitation, which is the more intense the higher the tempera-
ture, works against orderly alignment. The applied field makes it
energetically favorable for a molecular dipole to point parallel to
the field, but continually jostled by its neighbors, the best it can do
is to spend slightly more time pointing in the right direction than in
the wrong direction. In water, for example, a field of 1000 volts/cm
results in a polarization equivalent to perfectly aligning about one
molecule in 3000. Even so, this is a much greater polarization than
a nonpolar substance would exhibit in the same field, and is the
reason for the extraordinarily high dielectric constant of water. The
bulk polarization in a polar dielectric is generally proportional to
the applied electric field strength and inversely proportional to the
absolute temperature.

9.16 Polarization in Changing Fields

So far we have considered only electrostatic fields in matter. We
need to look at the effects of electric fields that are varying in time.
like the field in a capacitor used in an alternating --- current circuit.
The important question is, will the changes in polarization keep up
with the changes in the field? Will the ratio of P to E, at any instant.
be the same as in a static electric field? For very slow changes we
should expect no difference but, as always, the criterion for slowness
depends on the particular physical process. It turns out that induced

% p. 341
polarization and the orientation of permanent dipoles are two
processes with quite different response times.

The induced polarization of atoms and molecules occurs by the
distortion of the electronic structure. Little mass is involved and
the structure is very still‘; its natural frequencies of vibration are extremely
high. To put it another way, the motions of the electrons
in atoms and molecules are characterized by periods of the order
of 10-16 seconds --- something like the period of a visible light wave.
To an atom, 10-14 seconds is a long time. It has no trouble readjusting
its electronic structure in a time like that. Because of this,
strictly nonpolar substances behave practically the same from ``dc''
up to frequencies close to those of visible light. The polarization
keeps in step with the field and the susceptibility X,, = P/E is independent
of frequency. What happens when the frequency of the
field alternation does approach some natural frequency of the electronic
structure is an interesting question which we must leave for
the next volume. (One consequence is the rainbow!)

The orientation of a polar molecule is a process quite different
from the mere distortion of the electron cloud. The whole molecular

% p. 342
framework has to rotate. On a microscopic scale, it is rather like
turning a peanut end for end in a bag of peanuts. The frictional
drag tends to make the rotation lag behind the torque and to reduce
the amplitude of the resulting polarization. Where on the time scale
this effect sets in, varies enormously from one polar substance to
another. In water, the ``response time''-for dipole reorientation is
something like 10*`` seconds. The dielectric constant remains
around 80 up to frequencies of the order of 1010 cycles per second.
Above 1011 cycles/sec 5 falls to a modest value typical of a nonpolar
liquid. The dipoles simply cannot follow so rapid an alternation of
the field. In other substances, especially solids, the characteristic
time can be much longer. In ice just below the freezing point the
response time for electric polarization is around 10*?' seconds.
Figure 9.36 shows some experimental curves of dielectric constant
versus frequency for water and ice.

You may question whether a polar molecule could actually turn
over inside a compact rigid substance like a crystal. It does happen
in many crystals, where thanks to the vibration of its neighbors, a
molecule may suddenly find itself with enough ``elbow room" to
flip over as a unit. But the question is a good one, because in some
solids, shifts of electric charge can occur which are not describable
as rotations of permanent molecular dipole moments. We shall return
to this question presently.

9.17 The Bound-charge Current

Wherever the polarization in matter changes with time there is
an electric current, a genuine motion of charge. Suppose there are
N dipoles in a cubic centimeter of dielectric, and that in the time
interval dt each changes from p to p + dp. Then the macroscopic
polarization density P changes from P = Np to P + dP : N (p t dp).
Suppose the change dp was effected by moving a charge q through a
distance ds, in each atom: q ds = dp. Then during the time dt there
was actually a charge cloud of density P = Nq, moving with velocity
v = ds/dt. That is a conduction current of a certain density J in
(esu/sec)/cm2:

d d dP

The connection between rate of change of polarization and current
density, J = dP/dt, is independent of the details of the model. A

% p. 343
changing polarization is a conduction current, not essentially different
from any other.

Naturally, such a current is a source of magnetic field. If there
are no other currents around, we should write Maxwell's second
equation, curl B = (1/0) (EE/at + 4-zrJ) as

1

curl B = _C_  + 477  (78)

The only difference between an ``ordinary'' conduction current
density and the current density BP/at is that one involves free charge
in motion, the other bound charge in motion. There is one rather
obvious practical distinction ---  --- you can't have a steady bound charge
current, one that goes on forever unchanged. Usually we prefer to
keep account separately of the bound charge current and the free
charge current, retaining J as the symbol for the free charge current

density only. Then to include all the currents in Maxwell's equation
we have to write it this way:

curlB =  + 477% + 4wJ) (79)
T T
Bound charge Free charge
current density current density

In a dielectric medium, E + 47rP = (E, allowing a shorter version
of Eq. 79:

curl B = l (efl + 477.1) (80)
c at

More generally, Eq. 79 can also be abbreviated by introducing the
vector D, previously defined as E + 47rP:

cur1B = {E + 4vrJ) (81)
. c at

The term BD/at is usually referred to as the displacement current.
Actually, that part of it which involves BP/at represents, as we have
seen, an honest conduction current, real charges in motion. The
only part of the total current density that is not simply charge in
motion is the BE/at part, the true vacuum displacement current
which we discussed at the end of Chap. 7. Incidentally, if we want
to express all components of the full current density in units corre-

% p. 344
sponding to those of J, we should note that no 4-71 appears in the first
term, and fix that up by writing Eq. 79 as follows:

Involved in the distinction between bound charge and free charge
is a question we haven't squarely faced: can one always identify
unambiguously the ``molecular dipole moments'' in matter, especially
solid matter? The answer is no. Let us take a microscopic view of
a thin wafer of sodium chloride crystal. The arrangement of the
positive sodium ions and the negative chlorine ions was shown in
Fig. 1.7. Figure 9.37 is a cross section through the crystal, which
extends on out to the right and the left. If we choose to, we may
consider an adjacent pair of ions as a neutral molecule with a dipole
moment. Grouping them as in Fig. 9.37a, we describe the medium
as having a uniform macroscopic polarization density P, a vector
directed downward. At the same time, we observe that there is a
layer of positive charge over the top of the crystal, and negative
charge over the bottom which, not having been included in our mole-
cules, must be accounted free charge.

Now we might just as well have chosen to group the ions as in
Fig. 9.37b. According to that description, P is a vector upward, but
we have a negative free charge layer on top of the crystal and a positive
free charge layer beneath. Either description is correct. You will
have no trouble finding another one, also correct, in which P is zero
and there is no free charge. Each description predicts E = O. The
macroscopic field E is an observable physical quantity. It can depend
only on the charge distribution, not on how we choose to describe
the charge distribution.

This example teaches us that in the real atomic world the distinction
between ``bound charge'' and ``free charge'' is more or less
arbitrary, and so, therefore, is the concept of polarization density P.
The molecular dipole is a well-defined notion only where molecules
as such are identifiable --- where there is some physical reason for
saying, ``This atom belongs to this molecule and not to that.'' In
many crystals such an assignment is meaningless. An atom or ion
may interact about equally strongly with all its neighbors; one can
only speak of the whole crystal as a single molecule.

% p. 346
Any arbitrariness in the distinction between free and bound charge
persists, naturally, in the distinction between free charge current
density J, and 8P/at. Consider the polarization of a crystal such as
ice. The lattice is three-dimensional, but we have drawn in Fig. 9.38
a two-dimensional array with somewhat similar features. Let's call
it ice. In Fig. 9.38a we readily identify, the H20 molecules, for we
notice that each oxygen atom has just two H atoms close to it. The
crystal as shown is polarized. P points downward because, as mentioned
earlier in this chapter, the oxygen end of the water molecule
has an excess of negative charge. We can think of the black hydrogen
parts in the diagram as positive charge. Suppose now that something
happens to change the internal condition of this crystal to that
shown in Fig. 9.38d, a microscopic View of the same neighborhood.
Now the dipoles are reversed, and we describe the crystal as having
a polarization upward.

The change could have been brought about in two essentially different
ways, illustrated in Fig. 9.381) and c. In Fig. 9.3819 an upward-
directed electric field E has been applied, pushing upward the positive
ends of the molecules, in effect turning each molecule over.
There is a net upward motion of positive charge; the current that it
represents will be accounted for in the term 8P/at as we have just
learned.

Figure 9.380 depicts a quite different process, in which the application
of a downward electric field encourages the hydrogens to switch
partners. Each is migrating to the nearest 0 atom below it. (This
is all the easier, in the real crystal, because the H that lies between
two 0 atoms is to some degree shared by both, providing the ``hydro --- 
gen bond'' that holds the crystal together.) The final configuration
looks exactly the same. The dipoles are all reVersed --- but what occurred
was a downward flow of positive charge. If we are reckoning
up the current in this process, for entry on the right side of Eq. 79,
we have to put in the same term as before, BP/at, which corresponds
to an upward current, but we must add a larger downward conduction
current J, corresponding to the motion of each charge downward
by one whole lattice space d. The difference will be the true net cur-

rent arising from the actual downward displacement of the positive
charge through a distance 3.

Notice that in each case the total current flows in the direction of
the applied electric field. From macroscopic measurements alone
we could not tell which microscopic process is taking place. Indeed,
people are still arguing about the mechanism of polarization in ice.

% p. 347
To settle the argument, one needs to know enough about the microscopic
structure to be sure which is the easier, turning a molecule
upside down, or transferring protons. For us, the lesson to be drawn
is simply this: The actual microscopic motion of all the charges determines
the total conduction current, free and bound.

9.1 You have a supply of polyethylene tape, dielectric constant 2.3, 2.25 in.
wide and 0.001 in. thick; also, a supply of aluminum tape 2 in. wide and
0.0005 in. thick. You want to make a capacitor of about 0.05 pF capacitance,
in the form of a compact cylindrical roll. Describe how you might do this,
estimating the amount of tape of each kind that would be needed, and the
overall diameter of the finished capacitor.

9.2 In 1746 a Professor Musschenbroek in Leiden charged water in a bottle
by touching a wire, projecting from the neck of the bottle, to his electrostatic
machine. When his assistant, who was holding the bottle in one hand, tried to
remove the wire with the other, he got a violent shock. Thus did the simple
capacitor force itself on the attention of the electrical scientists. The discovery
of the ``Leyden jar'' revolutionized electrical experimentation. Already in
1747 Benjamin Franklin was describing his experiments with ``Mr. Musschen-
broek's wonderful bottle.'' The jar was really nothing but glass with a conductor
on each side of it. To see why it caused such a sensation, estimate the
capacitance of a jar made of a 1-liter bottle with walls 2 mm thick, the glass
having a dielectric constant 4. What diameter sphere, in air, would have the
same capacitance?

9.3 What is the magnitude of the dipole moment of each of the charge distributions
in parts (a), (b), and (c) of the figure? What is the direction of the
dipole moment vector p?

9.4 In the hydrogen chloride molecule the distance between the chlorine
nucleus and the proton is 1.28 A. Suppose the electron from the hydrogen
atom is transferred entirely to the chlorine atom, joining with the other electrons
to form a spherically symmetrical negative charge and centered on the
chlorine nucleus. How does the electric dipole moment of this model compare
with the actual HCI dipole moment given in Fig. 9.16? Where must the actual
``center of gravity'' of the negative charge distribution be located in the real
molecule? (The chlorine nucleus has a charge l7e, the hydrogen nucleus, a
charge e.)

9.5 A hydrogen chloride molecule is located at the origin with the H-Cl
line along the z axis and Cl uppermost. What is the direction of the electric
field, and its strength in statvolts/cm, at a point 10 A up from the origin, in
the z axis? at a point 10 A out from the origin on the y axis?

9.6 A parallel-plate capacitor, with a measured capacitance C = 250 cm
is charged to a potential difference of 6 statvolts. The plates are 1.5 cm apart.
We are interested in the field outside the capacitor, the so-called ``fringing"
field which we usually ignore. In particular, we would like to know the field
at a distance from the capacitor large compared to the size of the capacitor
itself. This can be found by treating the charge distribution on the capacitor
as a dipole. Estimate the electric field strength (a) at a point 3 meters from
the capacitor in the plane of the plates and (b) at a point the same distance
away, in a direction perpendicular to the plates.

9.7 In Sec. 4.11 we discussed the relaxation time of a capacitor filled with
a material having a resistivity p. If you will look back at that discussion you
will notice that we dodged the question of the dielectric constant of the mate-
rial. Now you can repair that omission. Introduce c properly into the expression
for the time constant. A leaky capacitor important to us all is formed
by the wall of a living cell, an insulator (among its many other functions!) that
separates two conducting fluids. Its electrical properties are of particular
interest in the case of the nerve cell, for the propagation of a nerve impulse
is accompanied by rapid changes in the electrical potential difference between
interior and exterior. In the footnote in Sec. 3.5, we remarked that the cell
membrane capacitor typically has a capacitance around 1 ,uF/cm? of membrane
area. It is believed that the membrane consists of material having a
dielectric constant about 3. You can now figure out what thickness this im-
plies. Other electrical measurements have indicated that the resistance of
1 cm? of cell membrane, measured from the conducting fluid on one side to
that on the other, is around 1000 ohms. Show that the time constant of such
a leaky capacitor is independent of the area of the capacitor. How large is it
in this case? Where would the resistivity p of such membrane material fall
on the chart of Fig. 4.6?

9.8 If all the molecular dipoles in a 1-mm-radius drop of water were pointed
the same way, what would be the maximum field strength (a) 10 cm away
from the drop‘? (12) at the surface of the drop?

9.9 Our formula for the dielectric sphere can actually serve to describe a
metal sphere in a uniform field. To demonstrate this, investigate the limiting
case, 5  --- > oo, and show that the external field then takes on a form which
satisfies the perfect-conductor boundary conditions. What about the internal
field? Make a sketch of some field lines for this limiting case. How large is
the dipole moment induced in a conducting sphere of radius a, in a field E0?
What would be the diameter of a perfectly conducting sphere that would have
the same polarizability as the hydrogen atom?

9.10 By what percentage does the induced dipole moment of a water
droplet (e = 81) dilfer from that of a ball bearing of the same diameter in the
same field?

9.11 In Sec. 9.10 the fact that the electric field is uniform inside the polarized
sphere was deduced from the form of the potential on the boundary. You
can also prove it by superposing the internal fields of two balls of charge whose
centers are separated. (a) Show that inside a spherical, uniform charge distribution
E is proportional to r. (b) Now take two spherical distributions with
density p and  --- p, centers at C1 and C2, and show that the resultant field is
constant and parallel to the line from C1 to C2. (c) Analyze in the same way
the field of a long circularly cylindrical rod which is polarized perpendicular
to its axis.

9.12 The figure shows three capacitors of the same area and plate separa-
tion. Call the capacitance of the vacuum condenser Co. Each of the others

re 9.13 Consider the capacitor simply as a device for storing energy. The
practical limitation on the potential difference between the plates of a capacitor
is the ``dielectric strength'' of the dielectric filling, which is the maximum
field strength that can exist in it without causing a spark. This is typically
around 105 volts/cm, for a good liquid dielectric with e : 2.3 and density 2
1 gm/cm3. Neglecting the weight of electrodes and case, how many joules of
energy can be stored per kilogram of capacitor? (Note that this is independent
of capacitance, shape, number of plates, etc.) Taking joules/kilogram as a
``figure-of-merit'' for an energy reservoir, compare the capacitor with an automobile
storage battery, and with a rotating flywheel. You will have to make
some reasonable guesses about the weight and energy output of a storage
battery, and you will have to decide what limits the speed of a flywheel. What
is an advantage of the capacitor as an energy reservoir?

Chapter 10 Magnetic Fields in Matter

10.1 How Various Substances Respond to a Magnetic Field

Imagine doing some experiments with a very intense magnetic
field. To be definite, suppose we have built a solenoid of 10-cm inside
diameter, 40 cm long, like the one shown in Fig. 10.1 Its outer
diameter is 40 cm, most of the space being filled with copper wind-
ings. This coil will provide a steady field of 30,000 gauss at its center
if supplied with 400 kilowatts of electrical power --- and something
like 30 gallons of water per minute, to carry off the heat. We mention
these practical details to show that our device, though nothing extra-
ordinary, is a pretty respectable laboratory magnet. The field
strength at the center is nearly 105 times the earth's field, and probably
5 or 10 times stronger than the field near any iron bar magnet
or horseshoe magnet you may have experimented with. The field
will be fairly uniform near the center of the solenoid, falling, on the
axis at either end, to roughly half its central value. It will be rather
less uniform than the field of the solenoid in Fig. 6.18. since our coil
is equivalent to a ``nested'' superposition of solenoids with length-
diameter ratio varying from 4/1 to 1/1. In fact, if we analyze our
coil in that way and use the formula (Eq. 6.44) which we derived for
the field on the axis of a solenoid with a single-layer winding, it is
not hard to calculate the axial field exactly. A graph of the field
strength on the axis, with the central field taken as 30 kilogauss, is
included in Fig. 10.1. The intensity just at the end of the coil is
18,000 gauss, and in that neighborhood the field is changing with a
gradient of approximately 1700 gauss/cm.

Let's put various substances into this field and see if a force acts
on them. Generally, we do detect a force. It vanishes when the
current in the coil is switched off. We soon discover that the force
is strongest not when our sample of substance is at the center of the
coil where the magnetic field B2 is strongest, but when it is located
near the end of the coil where the gradient, dBZ/dz, is large. From
now on let us support each sample just inside the upper end of the
coil. Figure 10.2 shows one such sample, contained in a test tube
suspended by a spring which can be calibrated to indicate the extra
force caused by the magnetic field. Naturally we have to make a

``blank'' experiment with the test tube and suspension alone, to allow
for the magnetic force on everything other than the sample.

We find in such an experiment that the force on a particular
substance --- meta1lic aluminum, for instance --- is proportional to the
mass of the sample and independent of its shape, as long as the
sample is not too large. (Experiments with a small sample in this
coil show that the force remains practically constant over a region a
few centimeters in extent, inside the end of the coil; if we use samples
no more than 1 to 2 cm3 in volume they can be kept well within this

% p. 354
region.) We can express our quantitative results, for a given sub-
stance, as so many dynes force per gram of sample, under the conditions
Bz = 18,000 gauss, dBz/dz = 1700 gauss/cm.

But first the qualitative results, which are a bit bewildering: For
a large number of quite ordinary pure substances the force observed,
although easily measurable, seems after all our effort to provide an
intense magnetic field, ridiculously small. It is ten or twenty dynes
per gram, typically, not more than a few percent of the weight of the
sample. It is upward for some samples, downward for others. This
has nothing to do with the direction of the magnetic field, as we can
verify by reversing the current in the coil. Instead, it appears that
some substances are always pulled in the direction of increasing field
intensity, others in the direction of decreasing field intensity, irrespective
of the field direction.

We do find some substances that are attracted into the coil with

considerably greater force. For instance, copper chloride crystals
are pulled downward with a force of 280 dynes per gram of sample.
Liquid oxygen behaves spectacularly in this experiment; it is pulled
into the coil with a force nearly eight times its weight. In fact, if we
were to bring an uncovered flask of liquid oxygen up to the bottom
end of our coil, the liquid would be lifted right out of the flask.
(Where do you think it would end up?) Liquid nitrogen, on the
other hand, proves to be quite unexciting; a gram of liquid nitrogen
is pushed away from the coil with the feeble force of 10 dynes. In the
table we have listed some results that one might obtain in such an
experiment. The substances, including those already mentioned,
have been chosen to suggest, as best one can with a sparse sampling,
the wide range of magnetic behavior we find in ordinary materials.

As you know, a few substances, of which the most familiar is
metallic iron, seem far more ``magnetic'' than any others. In the
table we give the force that would act on a 1-gm piece of iron put in
the same position in the field as the other samples. The force is
nearly a pound! (We would not have been so naive as to approach
our magnet with several grams of iron suspended in a test tube from
a delicate spring --- a different suspension would have to be used.)
Note that there is a factor of more than 105 between the force that
acts on a gram of iron and the force on a gram of copper, elements
not otherwise radically different. Incidentally, this suggests that
reliable magnetic measurements on a substance like copper may

not be easy. A few parts per million contamination by metallic iron
particles would utterly falsify the result.

There is another essential difference between the behavior of the
iron and the magnetite and that of the other substances in the table.
Suppose we make the obvious test, by varying the field strength of
the magnet, to ascertain whether the force on a sample is proportional
to the field. For instance, we might reduce the solenoid current
by half, thereby halving both the field intensity B2 and its gradient
dB,/dz. We would find, in the case of every substance above
iron in the table, that the force is reduced to one --- fourth its former
value, whereas the force on the iron sample, and that on the mag-
netite, would be reduced only to one-half or perhaps a bit less.
Evidently the force, under these conditions at least, is proportional
to the square of the field strength for all the other substances listed,
but nearly proportional to the field strength itself for Fe and Fe3O4.

 

% p. 356
It appears that we may be dealing with several different phenomena
here, and complicated ones at that. As a small step toward
understanding, we can introduce some classification.

First, those substances which are feebly repelled by our magnet,
water, sodium chloride, quartz, etc., are called diamagnetic. The
majority of inorganic compounds and practically all organic compounds
are diamagnetic. It turns out, in fact, that diamagnetism
is a property of every atom and molecule. When the opposite behavior
is observed, it is because the diamagnetism is outweighed by
a different and stronger effect, one that leads to attraction.

Substances which are attracted toward the region of stronger field
are called paramagnetic. In some cases, notably the metals such as
Al, Na, and many others, the paramagnetism is not much stronger
than the common diamagnetism. In other materials such as the
NiSO4 and the CuCl2 on our list, the paramagnetic effect is much
stronger. In these substances also, it increases as the temperature
is lowered, leading to quite large effects at temperatures near absolute
zero. The increase of paramagnetism with lowering temperature
is responsible in part for the large force recorded for liquid
oxygen. If you think all this is going to be easy to explain, observe
that copper is diamagnetic while copper chloride is paramagnetic.
but sodium is paramagnetic while sodium chloride is diamagnetic.

Finally, substances that behave like iron and magnetite are called
ferromagnetic. In addition to the common metals of this class, iron,
cobalt, and nickel, quite a number of ferromagnetic alloys and
crystalline compounds are known. Indeed current research in ferro-
magnetism is steadily lengthening the list.

In this chapter we have two tasks. One is to develop a treatment
of the large-scale phenomena involving magnetized matter, in which
the material itself is characterized by a few parameters and the
experimentally determined relations among them. It is like a treatment
of dielectrics based on some observed relation between electric
field and bulk polarization. We sometimes call such a theory phe-
nomenological. Our second task is to try to understand, at least in
a general way, the atomic origin of the various magnetic effects.
Even more than dielectric phenomena the magnetic effects, once
understood, reveal some basic features of atomic structure.

One general fact stands out in the table. Very little energy, on the
scale of molecular energies, is involved in diamagnetism and para-
magnetism. Take the extreme example of liquid oxygen. To pull

% p. 357
1 gm of liquid oxygen away from our magnet would require an
amount of work of the order of magnitude of 7,500 dynes times a
distance of a few centimeters (since the field strength falls off substantially
in a few centimeters' distance). Let us say, roughly,
50,000 ergs. Now it takes about 300 times that much energy (0.4
calories, or 1.6 joules) to raise the temperature of 1 gram of liquid 02
by one degree, and it takes more than 30,000 times as much energy
to vaporize the liquid, that is, to separate the molecules one from
another. Whatever may be happening in liquid oxygen at the molecular
level as a result of the magnetic field, it is apparently a very minor
afl``air in terms of energy.

We know that even strong magnetic fields have practically no
influence on chemical processes, and that goes for biochemistry too.
You can put your hand and forearm (not the one with the wrist
watch!) into our 30-kilogauss solenoid, without any significant
sensation or consequence. It is hard to predict whether your arm
will be paramagnetic or diamagnetic, but the force on it will be no
more than a fraction of an ounce, in any case. Generations of mice
have been bred and raised in strong magnetic fields without significant
changes. Nor, as of this writing, have other biological experiments
turned up anything remarkable in the way of magnetic effects
on chemical processes.'l' This is not surprising. In its interaction
with matter, the magnetic field plays a role utterly different from that
of the electric field. Because atoms and molecules are made of

slowly moving electric charges, electric forces overwhelmingly
dominate the molecular scene.

TThis is not to say that small effects are always inconsequential. After all, an argument
like the one we just used would show that gravity is energetically unimportant
on a molecular scale, yet trees on a hillside grow vertically. This presumably involves
the gross force on a biologicalunit larger than molecular size. Indeed, a somewhat
similar ``tropism" has been experimentally demonstrated in the case of seedlings growing
in a strongly inhomogeneous magnetic field. We are not suggesting, either, that
the magnetic properties of molecules are uninteresting to the biochemist. On the
contrary. the intermediates in chemical reactions are sometimes detectable, even identi-
fiable, by their magnetic behavior. But this is quite a different thing from the influence
of an external field on a chemical process. By the way, if you put your head in a
strong magnetic field and shake it, you will ``taste'' electrolytic currents in your mouth
 --- simply evidence of the induced electromotive force.

10.2 The Absence of Magnetic ``Charge''

The magnetic field outside a magnetized rod such as a compass
needle looks very much like the electric field outside an electrically
polarized rod, a rod that has an excess of positive charge at one end,
negative charge at the other (Fig. 10.3). It is conceivable that the
magnetic field has sources which are related to it the way electric
charge is related to the electric field. Then the ``north'' pole of the
compass needle would be the location of an excess of one kind of
``magnetic charge'' and the south pole would be the location of an
excess of the opposite kind. We might call ``north charge'' positive
and ``south charge'' negative, with magnetic field directed from positive
to negative, a rule like that adopted for electric field and electric
charge. Historically, that is how our convention about the positive
direction of magnetic field was establishedj What we have called
magnetic charge has usually been called magnetic pole strength.

This idea is perfectly sound as far as it goes. It becomes even more
plausible when we recall that the fundamental equations of the electromagnetic
field are quite symmetrical in E and B. Why, then,
should we not expect to find symmetry in the sources of the field?
With magnetic charge as a possible source of the static magnetic
field B, we would have div B = 47717, where 1; stands for the density
of magnetic charge, in complete analogy to the electric charge
density p. Two positive magnetic charges (or north poles) of unit
strength, 1 cm apart, would repel one another with a force of l dyne,
and so on.

The trouble is, that is not the way things are. Nature for some
reason has not made use of this opportunity. The world around us
appears totally asymmetrical in the sense that we find no magnetic
charges at all. No one has ever observed an isolated excess of one
kind of magnetic charge --- an isolated north pole for example. If
such an object existed it could be recognized in several ways. It
would give rise to a magnetic field directed radially outward from
the object and decreasing as 1/r2 at large distances. Perhaps even
more striking, such an object would experience a force if placed in

Tln Chap. 6, remember, we established the positive direction of B by reference to a
current direction (direction of motion of positive charge) and a right-hand rule. Now
``north pole'' means ``north-seeking pole'' of the compass needle. To this day we do
not understand why the earth's magnetic polarity should be one way rather than the
other. Franklin's designation of ``positive'' electricity had nothing to do with any of
this. So the fact that it takes a right-hand rule rather than a left~hand rule to make
this all consistent is the purest accident.

Fig. 10.3 (a) Two oppositely charged
disks (the electrodes showing in cross section
as solid black bars) have an electric
field which is the same as that ofa polarized
rod. That is, if you imagine such a rod to
occupy the region within the dashed bound-
ary, its external field would be like that
drawn. The electric field here was made
visible by a multitude of tiny black fibers,
suspended in oil, which orient themselves
along the field direction. This elegant
method of demonstrating electric field con-
figurationsT is due to Mr. Harold M. Waage,

versity, who has kindly prepared the original

a uniform magnetic field. Put in a solenoid, the magnetic pole would
experience the maximum force at the center of the coil rather than
at the end. And unlike the force on an electrically charged particle
moving in a magnetic field, the force on a magnetic pole at rest would
be parallel to the field instead of perpendicular to it.

From a region of space containing an isolated magnetic pole there
would be a net flux of B. The apparent total absence of such ob-

jects can thus be summarized by the statement that, instead of
div B = 47m, we find simply

div B = 0 everywhere (1)

Really everywhere? Could it be that there are north and south
poles inseparably united in pairs of equal and opposite strength, and
so close together that we cannot physically explore the region between
the members of a pair? We have no reason to think so, but
it wouldn't make any difference, for the statement of Eq. 1 would
still hold wherever B itself had any meaning. There has been serious
speculation, however, that pairs of poles, like pairs of elementary
particles, might be created and fly apart in very energetic nuclear
events. Several recent searches for such particles, termed magnetic
monopoles, have detected none.T Whether they cannot exist, and
if so why not, remains an open question. Should anyone ever discover
a monopole he will be entitled to add triumphantly after Eq. 1
the qualification ``. . . except at the location of this north (or south)
magnetic monopole that appears in my photographic plate (or
bubble-chamber picture, or counter record, etc.).'' But even that
would not affect the main conclusion: Ordinary matter is made up
of electric charges, and not magnetic charges.

TFor an account of the search for magnetic monopoles, see the article by Kenneth
Ford, ``Magnetic Monopoles,'' Sci. American 209, 30 (December, 1963). The ``asym-
metry'' evident in the absence of magnetic charge is quite different from the electrical
asymmetry we are familiar with, the difference in character between negative and
positive particles. Electrons are the stable negative particles; positive charge is found
in the form of the proton, a much heavier particle. But we know this need not be
universal, for the antiparticles are known to exist. All the evidence points to the possibility
of matter made up of positive electrons and negative protons; this ``antimatter''
would be the twin of the matter we find in our part of the universe. We have seen the
ingredients of an antimatter world in the laboratory --- but the ingredients of a ``mag-
netic twin'' have not been seen. There is serious doubt that they exist at all; and
there is a strong argument that if they do exist they must be quite different, in certain
other respects, from electrically charged particles.

% p. 361
We are forced to conclude that the only sources of the magnetic
field are electric currents. This takes us back to the hypothesis of
Ampere, his idea that magnetism in matter is to be accounted for by

a multitude of tiny rings of electric current distributed through the
substance.

10.3 The Field of a Current Loop

A closed conducting loop lies in the xy plane encircling the origin,
as in Fig. l0.4a. A steady current I, measured in esu/sec, flows
around the loop. We are interested in the magnetic field this current
creates --- not near the loop, but at distant points like P1 in the figure.
We shall assume that r1, the distance to P1, is much larger than any
dimension of the loop. To simplify the diagram we have located P1
in the gz plane; it will turn out that this is no restriction. This is a
good place to use the vector potential. We shall compute first the
vector potential A at the location P1, that is, A(0,y1,z1). From this
it will be obvious what the vector potential is at any other point

(x,y,z) far from the loop. Then by taking the curl of A we shall get
the magnetic field B.

For a current confined to a wire, we had, as Eq. 6.35:
/
1 fl

A(0'y1'z1) = F Loop T12

(2)

At that time we were concerned only with the contribution of a small
segment of the circuit; now we have to integrate around the entire
loop. Consider the variation in the denominator r12 as we go around
the loop. If P1 is far away, the first-order variation in r12 depends
only on the coordinate yg of the segment dlg, and not on x2. This
should be clear from the side view sketched in Fig. 10.4b. Thus,
neglecting quantities proportional to (x2/r12)2, we may treat rm
and r{2, which lie on top of one another in the side view, as equal.
And in general, to first order in the ratio (loop dimension/distance
to P1) we have

T12Z1‘1  ---  yg SlI10 

Look now at the two elements of the path dlg and dlé, shown in
Fig. 10.4a. For these the dy2's are equal and opposite, and as we
have already pointed out, the r12's are equal to first order. To this

order then, their contributions to the line integral will cancel, and
this will be true for the whole loop. Hence A at P1 will not have a
y component. Obviously it will not have a z component, for the
current path itself has nowhere a z component. The x component

of the vector potential comes from the dx part of the path integral.
Thus

Am%m=#-@- m
C T12

Without spoiling our first-order approximation, we can turn Eq. 3
into

;:;O+mm% m
712 7'1 T1

and using this for the integrand we have

Amymo=2l --- (L+W````%dm (o

crl r1

In the integration r1 and 0 are constants. Obviouslyfdxg around
the loop vanishes. Now I yg dxg around the loop is just the area
of the loop, regardless of its shape (see Fig. l0.4c). So we get finally

A(0,y1,z1) = ,2 1:312'' x (area ofloop) (7)

Here is a simple but crucial point: Since the shape of the loop
hasn't mattered, our restriction of P1 to the yz plane can't make any
essential difference. Therefore we must have in Eq. 7 the general
result we seek, if only we state it generally: The vector potential of
a current loop of any shape, at a distance r from the loop which is
much greater than the size of the loop, is a vector perpendicular to

the plane containing r and the normal to the plane of the loop, of
magnitude

or?

where a stands for the area of the loop.

This vector potential is symmetrical around the axis of the loop,
which implies that the field B will be symmetrical also. The explanation
is that we are considering regions so far from the loop that the
details of the shape of the loop have negligible influence. All loops

% p. 364
 

with the same current x area product produce the same far field.
We call the product Ia/c the magnetic dipole moment of the current
loop, and denote it by m. The magnetic dipole moment is evidently
a vector, its direction being that of the normal to the loop, or that
of the Vector a, the directed area of the patch surrounded by the loop

I
=  ---  9
In C a ( )
As for sign, we‘ agree that the direction of m and the sense ofpositive
current flow in the loop are to be related by a right-hand-screw rule,
illustrated in Fig. 10.5. (The dipole moment of the loop in Fig. 10.4a
points downward, according to this rule.) The vector potential for

the field of a magnetic dipole in can now be written neatly with
vectors:

(10)

where fr is a unit vector in the direction from the loop to the point for
which A is being computed. You can check that this agrees with
our convention about sign. Note that the direction of A must always
be that of the current in the nearest part of the loop.

Figure 10.6 shows a magnetic dipole located at the origin, with the
dipole moment vector m pointed in the positive z direction. To express
the vector potential at any point (x,y,z), we observe that
r2 : x2 + y? + 2:2, and sin 0 = \/2fij --- 1 --- g;7/r. The magnitude A of
the vector potential at that point is

A: msin0 = my/x:3+ y2 (11)

Since A is tangent to a horizontal circle around the z axis, its components
are:

Let's evaluate B for a point in the xz plane, by finding the components
of curl A and then (not before!) setting y = O.

In the xz plane, y = 0, sin 0 = x/r, and cos 0 = z/r. The field components
at any point in that plane are thus given by:

Now turn back to Sec. 9.3, where in Eq. 9.14 we had expressed
the components in the xz plane of the field E of an electric dipole p,
which was situated exactly like our magnetic dipole m. The expressions
are identical. We have thus found that the magnetic field of a
small current loop has at remote points the same form as the electric
field of two separated charges. We already know what that field,
the electric dipole field, looks like. Figure 10.7 is an attempt to
suggest the three-dimensional form of the magnetic field B arising
from our current loop with dipole moment In.

The magnetic field close to a current loop is entirely different from
the electric field close to a pair of separated positive and negative
charges, as the comparison in Fig. 10.8 shows. Notice that between
the charges the electric field points down, while inside the current

ring the magnetic field points up, although the far fields are alike.
This reflects the fact that our magnetic field satisfies V - B = 0 every-
where, even inside the source. The magnetic field lines don't end.
By near and far we mean, of course, relative to the size of the current
loop or the separation of the charges. If we imagine the current ring
shrinking in size, the current meanwhile increasing so that the dipole
moment m = Ia/c remains constant, we approach the infinitesimal

magnetic dipole, the counterpart of the infinitesimal electric dipole
described in Chap. 9.

10.4 The Force on a Dipole in an External Field

Consider a small circular current loop of radius r, placed in the
magnetic field of some other current system, such as a solenoid. In
Fig. 10.9, a field B is drawn that is generally in the z direction. It is
not a uniform field. Instead, it gets weaker as we proceed in the
z direction; that is evident from the fanning out of the field lines.
Let us assume, for simplicity, that the field is symmetric about the
z axis. Then it resembles the field near the upper end of the solenoid
in Fig. 10.1. The field represented in Fig. 10.9 does not include the
magnetic field of the current ring itself. We want to find the force

on the current ring caused by the other field, which we shall call, for
want of a better name, the external field. The net force on the current
ring due to its own field is certainly zero, so we are free to ignore
its own field in this discussion.

If you study the situation in Fig. 10.9 you will soon conclude that
there is a net force on the current ring. It arises because the external
field B has an outward component B, everywhere around the ring.
Therefore if the current flows in the direction indicated, each element
of the loop, dl, must be experiencing a downward force of magnitude
IB, dl/c. If B, has the same magnitude at all points on the
ring, as it must in the symmetrically spreading field assumed, the
total downward force will have the magnitude,

_ 27rrIB,
 ---  c

F (15)

% p. 368
Now B, can be directly related to the gradient of Bz. Since
div B = O at all points, the net flux of magnetic field out of any
volume is zero. Consider the little cylinder of radius r and height Az
(Fig. 10.10). The outward flux from the side is 27rr(Az)B, and the
net outward flux from the end surfaces is .

7rr2[ --- Bz(z) + B,(z + Az)]

which to the first order in the small distance Az is 7rr2(2)Bz/az) A2.
Setting the total flux equal to zero: 0 = 7rr2(aBz/az) Az + 2vrrB, Az,
which gives us the relation,

BT=_LBBz

16
Zaz ()

As a check on the sign, notice that according to Eq. 16, B, is positive
when B2 is decreasing upward; a glance at the figure shows that to
be correct.

The force on the dipole can now be expressed in terms of the
gradient of the component B; of the external field:

F_27rrI_18Bz_ 7rr2I.8Bz
 ---  c 2 Bz _ c 8;'

(17)

In the factor 7rr2I/c we recognize the magnitude m of the magnetic
dipole moment of our current ring. So the force on the ring can be
expressed very simply in terms of the dipole moment:

8B,,
62:

F = m (18)
We haven't proved it, but you will not be surprised to hear that for
small loops of any other shape the force depends only on the current-
area product, that is, on the dipole moment. The shape doesn't
matter. Of course, we are discussing only loops small enough so
that only the first-order variation of the external field, over the span
of the loop, is significant.

Our ring in Fig. 10.9 has a magnetic dipole moment m pointing
upward and the force on it is downward. Obviously, if we could
reverse the current in the ring, thereby reversing m, the force would
reverse its direction. The situation can be summarized this way:

Dipole moment parallel to external field: Force acts in direction
of increasing field strength.

Dipole moment antiparallel to external field: Force acts in
direction of decreasing field strength.

Uniform external field: Zero force.

% p. 369
Quite obviously, this is not the most general situation. The
moment in could be pointing at some odd angle with respect to the
field B, and the different components of B could be varying, spatially,
in different ways. It is not hard to develop a formula for the force F
that is experienced in the general case. It would be exactly like the
general formula we gave, as Eq. 9.22, for the force on an electric
dipole in a nonuniform electric field. That is, the x component of
force on any magnetic dipole m is given by

F, = m-grad B, (19)

with corresponding formulas for F,, and F2.

In Eqs. 18 and 19 the force is in dynes, with the magnetic field
gradient in gauss/cm and the magnetic dipole moment m given by
Eq. 9, m = Ia/c where I is in esu/ sec, a in square centimeters, and c
in cm/ sec. There are several equivalent ways to express the units
of m. We shall adopt ``ergs/gauss.'' As you can see from Eq. 18,

dynes _ dyne --- cm __ ergs

m : (gauss/cm) _ gauss _ gauss

Now we can begin to see what must be happening in the experiments
described at the beginning of this chapter. A substance
located at the position of the sample in Fig. 10.2 would be attracted
into the solenoid if it contained magnetic dipoles parallel to the field
B of the coil. It would be pushed out of the solenoid if it contained
dipoles pointing in the opposite direction, antiparallel to the field.
The force would depend on the gradient of the axial field strength,
and would be zero at the midpoint of the solenoid. Also, if the total
strength of dipole moments in the sample were proportional to the
field strength B, then in a given position the force would be proportional
to B times BB/az, and hence to the square of the solenoid cur-
rent. That is the observed behavior in the case of the diamagnetic
and the paramagnetic substances. It looks as if the ferromagnetic
samples must have possessed a magnetic moment nearly independent
of field strength, but we must set them aside for a special discussion
anyway.

How does the application of a magnetic field to a substance evoke
in the substance magnetic dipole moments with total strength proportional
to the applied field? And why should they be parallel to
the field in some substances, and oppositely directed in others? If
we can answer these questions we shall be on the way to understanding
the physics of diamagnetism and paramagnetism.

10.5 Electric Currents in Atoms

We know that an atom consists of a positive nucleus surrounded
by negative electrons. To describe it fully we would need the concepts
of quantum physics that you will be studying later in this
course. Fortunately, a simple and easily visualized model of an
atom can explain diamagnetism very well. It is a planetary model
with the electrons in orbits around the nucleus, like the model in
Bohr's first quantum theory of the hydrogen atom.

We begin with one electron moving at constant speed on a circular
path. Since we are not attempting here to explain atomic structure,
we shall not inquire into the reasons why the electron has this particular
orbit. We ask only, if it does move in such an orbit, what
magnetic effects are to be expected? In Fig. 10.1] we see the elec-
tron, visualized as a particle carrying a concentrated electric charge
 ---  e, moving with speed 12 on a circular path of radius r. In the middle
is a positive nuclear charge, making the system electrically neutral,
but the nucleus, because of its relatively great mass, moves so slowly
that its magnetic effects can be neglected.

At any instant, the electron and the positive charge would appear
as an electric dipole, but on the time average the electric dipole
moment is zero, producing no steady electric field at.a distance. We
discussed this point in Sec. 9.5. The magnetic field of the system,
far away, is not zero on the time average. Instead, it is just the field
of a current ring. For, as concerns the time average, it can't make
any diflerence whether we have all the negative charge gathered into
one lump, going around the track, or distributed in bits, as in
Fig. l0.11b, to make a uniform endless procession. The current is
the amount of charge that passes a given point on the ring,_per
second. Since the electron makes v/2771 revolutions per second, the
current, in esu/sec if e is in esu, is

I = L'' 20

2M ( )
The orbiting electron is equivalent to a ring current of this magnitude
with the direction of positive flow opposite to v, as shown in
Fig. l0.llc. Its far field is therefore that of a magnetic dipole. of

7rr2I evr

m: C :20 (21)

Let us note in passing a simple relation between the magnetic
moment m associated with the electron orbit, and the orbital angular

% p. 371
momentum L. The angular momentum is a vector of magnitude
L = mevr, where rne denotes the mass of the electron,T and it points
downward if the electron is revolving in the sense shown in

Fig. 10.1la. Notice that the product or occurs in both m and L.
With due regard to direction, we can write:

in: ‘E L (22)
Zrnec

This relation involves nothing but fundamental constants, which
should make you suspect that it holds quite generally. Indeed that
is the case, although we shall not prove it here. It holds for elliptical
orbits, and it holds even for the rosettelike orbits that occur in a
central field that is not inverse-square. Remember the important
property of any orbit in a central field: Angular momentum is a constant
of the motion. It follows then, from the general relation expressed
by Eq. 22 (derived by us only for a special case), that where-
ever angular momentum is conserved, the magnetic moment also
remains constant in magnitude and direction. The factor

 ---  e
Zmec

is called the orbital magnetornechanical ratio for the electron.1 The
intimate connection between magnetic moment and angular momentum
is central to any account of atomic magnetism.

Why don't we notice the magnetic fields of all the electrons orbiting
in all the atoms of every substance? The answer must be that
there is a mutual cancellation. In an ordinary lump of matter there
must be as many electrons going around one way as the other. This
is to be expected, for there is nothing to make one sense of rotation
intrinsically easier than another, or otherwise to distinguish any
unique axial direction. There would have to be something in the

structure of the material to single out not merely an axis, but a sense
of rotation around that axis!

TWe shall be dealing with speeds 0 much less than c, so me stands for the rest mass,
9.0 x 10'''' gm. Our choice of the symbol m for magnetic moment makes it neces-
sary, in this chapter, to use a different symbol for the electron mass. For angular
momentum we choose the symbol L, rather than J as used in Vol. 1, Chap. 6, because
L is traditionally used in atomic physics for orbital angular momentum, which is what
we here consider, and because we have been using J for current density.

:{:Many people use the term gyromagnetic ratio for this quantity. We prefer mag-
netomechanical ratio, as used in Vol. 1, Chap. 8.

We may picture a piece of matter, in the absence of any external
magnetic field, as containing revolving electrons with their various
orbital angular momentum vectors and associated orbital magnetic
moments distributed evenly over all directions in space. Consider
those orbits which happen to have their planes approximately parallel
to the xy plane, of which there will be about equal numbers with
m up and in down. Let's find out what happens to one of these orbits
when we switch on an external magnetic field in the z direction.

We'll analyze first an electromechanical system that doesn't look
much like an atom. In Fig. 10.12 there is an object of mass M and
electric charge q, tethered to a fixed point by a cord of fixed length r.
This cord provides the centripetal force that holds the object in its
circular orbit. The magnitude of that force F0 is given, as we
know, by

M002
1'

F0 = (23)

In the initial state, Fig. 10.l2a, there is no external magnetic field.
Now, by means of some suitable large solenoid, we begin creating
a field B in the negative z direction, uniform over the whole region
at any given time. While this field is growing at the rate dB/dt, there
will be an induced electric field E all around the path, as indicated in
Fig. 10.1219. To find the magnitude of this field E we note that the
rate of change of flux through the circular path is

(24)

This determines the line integral of the electric field, which is really all

that matters (we only assume for symmetry and simplicity that it
is the same all around the path).

force, you will see that E must be in a direction to accelerate the body,

if q is a positive charge. The acceleration along the path, do/dt, is
determined by the force qE:

so that we have a relation between the change in v and the change
in B:

_ ‘V
dv _. 2M0 dB (28)

The radius r being fixed by the length of the cord, the factor (qr/2Mc)
is a constant. Let Av denote the net change in v in the whole process
of bringing the field up to the final value B1. Then:

_ u0+Av _ qr B1 _ qrB1 29
A0 -1.10 do _ 2Mcjt> dB_ 2Mc ( )

Notice that the time has dropped out --- the final velocity is the same
whether the change is made slowly or quickly.

The increased speed of the charge in the final state means an increase
in the upward-directed magnetic moment m. A negatively
charged body would have been decelerated under similar circum-
stances, which would have decreased its downward moment. In
either case, then, the application of the field B1 has brought about
a change in magnetic moment opposite to the field. The magnitude
of the change in magnetic moment Am, is

_ _ qr _ q2,.2
Am _ ?c --- Av _  ---  ---  --- 4MC2

B1 (30)

Likewise for charges, either positive or negative, revolving in the
other direction, the induced change in magnetic moment is opposite
to the change in applied magnetic field. Figure 10.13 shows this for

a positive charge. It appears that the following relation holds for
either sign of charge and either direction of revolution:

In this example we forced r to be constant by using a cord of fixed
length. Let us see how the tension in the cord has changed. We
shall assume that B1 is small enough so that Av < 00. In the final
state we require a centripetal force of magnitude:

_ M(u0 + Av)? M1302 + 2Mv0 Av

neglecting the term proportional to (Av)? But now the magnetic
field itself provides an inward force on the moving charge, given by
q(vo + Av)B1/c. Using Eq. 29 to express B1 in terms of Au, we find
that this extra inward force has the magnitude 0 T
which, to first order in Av/vo, is 2Mvo Av/r. That is just what is
needed, according to Eq. 32, to avoid any extra demand on our cord!
Hence the tension in the cord remains unchanged, at the value F0.

This points to a surprising conclusion: our result, Eq. 31 must be
valid for any kind of tethering force that varies with radius. Our
cord could be replaced by an elastic spring without affecting the
outcome --- the radius would still be unchanged in the final state.
Or to go at once to a system we are interested in, it could be replaced
by the Coulomb attraction of a nucleus for an electron. Or it could
be the effective force that acts on one electron in an atom containing
many electrons, which has a still diflerent dependence on radius.

q(vo + Av) _ 2Mc Av

% p. 375
From a relation as general as Eq. 31 has turned out to be, we can hope
for some meaningful results even without a good theory of atomic
structure. The only feature of the atom that appears explicitly is r2.
Of course, we must observe the restriction Av/vo < 1, in effect a
restriction on B1, which allowed this general application.

The effect on electron orbits of switching on a magnetic field B can
be visualized in this way: Every electron continues to revolve at the
same radius, but its angular velocity, which had been :00/r, depending
on its sense of revolution, has added to it a small increment
Aw = Av/r. According to Eq. 29 the value of this increment is

Av eB
A : T :-
w r Zmec (33 )

an angular velocity depending only on the strength of the applied
field and the charge-mass ratio of the electron. All revolutions one
way are speeded up by the same amount, expressed in radians per
second, those in the other direction slowed down by the same
amount. The new system looks just like the old system Viewed from
a rotating frame of reference. The angular velocity eB/Zmec in Eq. 33
is called the ``Larmor angular velocity,'' or ``Larmor frequency.''
Sir Joseph Larmor, the British mathematical physicist, proved this
general theorem in 1895, before anyone really knew how an atom
is constructed.

We have considered only orbits perpendicular to B. Our conclusion
should apply, roughly speaking, to a third of the electron
orbits in a substance, there being three mutually perpendicular
directions. What happens to orbits lying parallel to the xz planes
and yz planes is interesting, and you can find out by working
Prob. 10.22. They also contribute an induced moment opposite to
the field and proportional to the square of the orbit radius. The
effect of all the orbits can be summarized in an equation like Eq. 31,
with 72 replaced by (r2), the average of the squares of the orbit radii,
and with some numerical factor to take care of averaging over orbit
orientation. H

Without going into this refinement, 1et's use Eq. 31 as it stands
for all the electrons, putting in some reasonable estimate for an orbit
radius, and see if we can approximately account for some of the data
in the table. The number of electrons per gram is about the same
in most substances, because there is one proton in the nucleus for
every electron in the atom, and roughly one neutron per proton. So
the number of electrons per gram, n, is about the same as in a sub-

% p. 376
stance of atomic weight 2 and atomic number 1, namely:

n z  ---  --- 6 X21023 = 3 x 1023 (34)
For r we shall put in 0.5 x l0‘8 cm, a distance you will become very
familiar with later as a typical atomic ``radius.'' In many-electron
atoms, naturally, some electrons have large orbits and some small.
For M we substitute the electron mass me. The magnetic field
strength at the location of the sample was 18,000 gauss. Then the
total magnetic moment induced in one gram of almost anything
should be, roughly:

= 0.95 X 10‘? (35)

nAm=

The gradient of the field BB3/Bz was 1700 gauss/cm. Using Eq. 18
to calculate the force, we would predict a force of magnitude
1700 X 0.95 X l0‘2, or about 16 dynes. This is close to the figure
given for a number of substances in the table. Indeed, it is closer

than we had any right to expect, so the agreement is to that extent
accidentalj

We had better make sure that our assumption Av < 00 is fulfilled

in this situation. Putting the same numbers into Eq. 29, we can
estimate Av:

Av _ erB _ (4.8 x 10-10)(0.5 x 10‘8)(18,O00)
‘ Zmec ‘ 2(9 x 10-28) (3 x 1010)

: 103 cm/sec (36)

You don't need to know much atomic physics to realize that
103 cm/sec is small compared to the speed of an electron in an atom.
A man can run that fast! A typical Velocity for an atomic electron
is more like 103 cm/ sec, or higher. This shows that even our rather
powerful magnet applies a field that is very weak, from the point of

view of an atomic electron, causing only a slight change in the speeds
of revolution.

'rThe exact formula, obtained by averaging over orbits isotropically oriented, replaces
the factor } in Eq. 31 by §, while replacing r2 by (12). A rigorous quantum
mechanical theory leads to exactly the same result, and the agreement with experi-

ment is excellent. Indeed, for many diamagnetic atoms the magnetic measurements
provide the most accurate way to determine (r2).

% p. 377
We can see now why diamagnetism is a universal phenomenon,
and a rather inconspicuous one. It is about the same in molecules
as in atoms. The fact that a molecule can be a much larger structure
than an atom --- it may be built of hundreds or thousands of atoms-
does not generally increase the effective mean-square orbit radius.
The reason is that in a molecule any given electron is pretty well
localized on an atom. There are some interesting exceptions and
we included one in the table --- graphite. The anomalous diamag-
netism of graphite is due to an unusual structure which permits some

electrons to circulate rather freely within a planar group of atoms
in the crystal lattice.

10.6 Electron Spin and Magnetic Moment

The electron possesses angular momentum that has nothing to
do with its orbital motion. It behaves in many ways as if it were
continually rotating around an axis of its own. This property is
called spin. When the magnitude of the spin angular momentum
is measured, the same result is always obtained: h/47-r, where h is
Planck's constant. Electron spin is a quantum phenomenon. You
will hear more about its discovery and its implications in Vol. IV of
this course. Its significance for us now lies in the fact that there is
associated with this intrinsic, or ``built-in,'' angular momentum a
nuzgnetic moment, likewise of invariable magnitude. This magnetic
moment points in the direction you would expect if you visualize
the electron as a ball of negative charge spinning around its axis.
That is, the magnetic moment vector points antiparallel to the spin
angular momentum vector, as indicated in Fig. 10.14. The magnetic
moment, however, is twice as large, relative to the angular momen-
tum, as is the case in orbital motion.

There is no point in trying to devise a classical model of this object;
its properties are essentially quantum mechanical. We need not
even go so far as to say it is a current loop. What matters is only that
it behaves like one in the following respects: (i) it produces a magnetic
field which, at a distance, is that of a magnetic dipole; (ii) in an
external field B it experiences a torque equal to that which would
act on a current loop of equivalent dipole moment; (iii) within the
source, div B = O everywhere, as in the ordinary sources of magnetic
field with which we are already familiar.

Since the magnitude of the spin magnetic moment is always the
same, the only thing an external field can influence is its direction.
A magnetic dipole in an external field experiences a torque. If you

% p. 378
 

 

worked through Prob. 6.22, you proved that the torque N on a current
loop of any shape, with dipole moment m, in a field B, is given by

For those who have not been through that demonstration, let's take
time out to calculate the torque in a simple special case. In Fig. 10.15
we see a rectangular loop of wife carrying current I. The loop has
a magnetic moment in, of magnitude m = Iab/c. The torque on
the loop arises from the forces F1 and F2 that act on the horizontal
wires. Each of these forces has the magnitude F = IbB/c, and its
moment arm is"the distance (a/ 2) sin 0. We see that the magnitude

of the torque on the loop is

N: 2'''7B-%sino = (%)13sino = mBsin0 (38)

The torque acts in a direction to bring in parallel to B; it is represented
by a vector N in the positive x direction, in the situation
shown. All this is consistent with the general formula, Eq. 37.
Notice that Eq. 37 corresponds exactly to the formula we derived
in Chap. 9 for the torque on an electric dipole p in an external field E,
namely, N = p x E. The orientation with m in the direction of B,
like that of the electric dipole parallel to E, is the position of lowest
energy. Similarly, the work required to rotate a dipole in from parallel
to antiparallel is 2mB. (See Eq. 9.18; we can simply take over
this result for the magnetic case.)

If the electron spin moments in a substance are free to orient them-
selves, we expect them to prefer the orientation in the direction of
any applied field B, the orientation of lowest energy. Suppose every
electron in a gram of material takes up this orientation. We had
already calculated that there are roughly 3 X 1023 electrons in a gram
of anything. The spin magnetic moment of an electron, ms, is given
in Fig. 10.14 as 0.93 X 1O‘2° erg/gauss. The total magnetic moment
of our lined-up spins will be (3 )< 1023) X (0.9 )( 10-20) or 2700
ergs/gauss. The force on such a sample, in our coil where the field
gradient was 1700 gauss/cm, would be 4.6 x 106 dynes, or a little
over ten pounds!

Obviously this is much greater than the force recorded for any of
the paramagnetic samples. The explanation is that the alignment
of the electron moments is very far from perfect. Thermal agitation

% p. 379
tends always to create a chaotic, or random, distribution of spin-axis
directions. The degree of alignment that actually prevails represents
a compromise between the preference for the direction of lowest
energy and the disorienting influence of thermal motion. It turns
out that the total magnetic moment is generally proportional to the
applied field B, and inversely proportional to the absolute temperature
T. How that works out we must leave for Vol. V of this course,
the theme of which might be described as the competition involving
energy and disorder. The paramagnetism of electron spins will
provide, at that time, an instructive example. The quantum physics
you will learn between now and then will make the problem simpler
than it appears from our present viewpoint.

Why isn't everything paramagnetic? The reason is that in most
atoms and molecules, the electrons are grouped in pairs, with the
spins in each pair constrained to point in opposite directions regardless
of the applied field. As a result, the magnetic moments of an
electron pair exactly cancel each other. All that is left is the diamag-
netism we had already explored. A few molecules contain an odd
number of electrons, and in them total cancellation in pairs is obviously
impossible. Nitric oxide, NO, with 15 electrons in the molecule
is an instance: it is paramagnetic. The oxygen molecule 02
contains an even number of electrons, but its electronic structure
happens to favor noncancellation of two of the electron spins. In
certain groups of the elements, notably the elements around gadolinium
in the periodic table, and also those around iron, the atoms
contain unpaired electron spins which are relatively free to orient
in a magnetic field. (The magnetic moment of such an atom often
includes some contribution from the orbital motion as well.) In
metallic conductors, the ``free'' electrons that roam through the metal
have a weakly paramagnetic behavior all their own. All of this is
basically quantum physics.

Even diamagnetism, fundamentally, involves quantum mechanics.
Consider two electrons circling in opposite directions in an atom.
We explained that diamagnetism arises because an applied field B
causes one electron to speed up slightly and the other to slow down.
But why don't both orbits eventually shift around so their orbital
magnetic moments are pointing in the same direction, parallel to
the field? The answer is that the two electrons, in most cases, are
required by quantum mechanical laws to maintain opposite direc-

tions of orbital revolution, much as the electron spins are paired ofi``
two by two.

% p. 380
10.7 Magnetic Susceptibility

We have seen that both diamagnetic and paramagnetic substances
develop a magnetic moment proportional to the applied field. At
least, that is true under most conditions. At very low temperatures,
in fairly strong fields, the induced paramagnetic moment can be
observed to approach a limiting value as the field strength is in-
creased. Setting this ``saturation'' effect aside, the relation between
moment and applied field is quite linear, so that we can characterize
the magnetic properties of a substance by the ratio of induced
moment to applied field. The ratio is called the magnetic suscepti-
bility. Depending on whether we choose the moment of 1 gm of
material, of 1 cm3 of material, or of 1 mole, we define the specific
susceptibility, the volume susceptibility, or the molar susceptibility.
Our discussion in Sec. 10.5 suggests that for diamagnetic substances
the specific susceptibility, based on the induced moment per gram,
should be most nearly the same from one substance to another..
However, the volume susceptibility, based on the induced magnetic
moment per cubic centimeter, is more relevant to our present
concerns.

The magnetic moment per unit volume we shall call the magnetic
polarization, or the magnetization, using for it the symbol M. Now
magnetization M and magnetic field B have similar dimensions.T
To verify that, recall that the field B of a magnetic dipole is given by

volume '
magnetic susceptibility, denoted by x,,,, through the relation

,while M, as we have just defined it, has the

dimensions If we now define the volume

M = X,,,B (warning: see remarks below) (39)

the susceptibility will be a dimensionless number, negative for dia-
magnetic substances, positive for paramagnetic. This is exactly
analogous to the procedure, expressed in Eq. 9.38, by which we
defined the electric susceptibility Xe as the ratio of electric polarization
P to electric field E. We shall presently see that the analogy goes
even deeper because the macroscopic field B inside matter will turn
out to be the average of the microscopic B, just as the macroscopic E
turned out to be the average of the microscopic E.

TWhile the dimensions of M and B are the same, it would be confusing to express
them in the same units, because of a factor 47r that will turn up presently. If and
when a name for the units of M is called for, we shall use ergs/gauss-cm3.

% p. 381
Unfortunately, Eq. 39 is not the customary definition of volume
magnetic susceptibility. In the usual definition another field H,
which we shall meet in due course, appears instead of B (see Eq. 55).
Although illogical, the definition in terms of H has a certain practical
justification, and the tradition is so well established that we shall
eventually have to bow to it. But in this chapter we want to follow
as long as we can a path that naturally and consistently parallels the
description of the electric fields in matter.

The difference in definition is of no practical consequence as long
as X," is a number very small compared to one. The values of xm
for purely diamagnetic substances, solid or liquid, lie typically between
-0.5 X 10‘6 and -1.0 )< 10*'. Even for oxygen under the
conditions given in the table, the paramagnetic susceptibility is less
than 10-3. This means that the magnetic field caused by the dipole
moments in the substance, at least as a large-scale average, is very
much weaker than the applied field B. That gives us some confidence
that in such systems we may assume the field that acts on the
atomic dipole to orient them is the same as the field that would exist
there in the absence of the sample. However, we shall be interested
in other systems in which the field of the magnetic moments is not
small. Therefore we must study, just as we did in the case of electric
polarization, the magnetic fields that magnetized matter itself pro-
duces, both inside and outside the material.

10.8 The Magnetic Field Caused by Magnetized Matter

A block of material which contains, evenly distributed through its
volume, a large number of atomic magnetic dipoles all pointing in
the same direction, is said to be uniformly magnetized; The magnetization
vector M is simply the product of the number of oriented
dipoles per unit volume and the magnetic moment In of each dipole.
We don't care how the alignment of these dipoles is maintained.
There may be some field applied from another source, but we are

not interested in that. We want to study only the field produced
by the dipoles themselves.

Consider first a slab of material of thickness dz, sliced out perpendicular
to the direction of magnetization, as shown in Fig. 10. 16a.
The slab can be divided into little tiles. One such tile, which has a
top surface of area da, contains a total dipole moment amounting to
M da dz, since M is the dipole moment per unit volume (Fig. 10.1619).
The magnetic field this tile produces at all distant points --- distant

% p. 382
 

 

compared to the size of the tile --- is just that of any dipole with the
same magnetic moment. We could construct a dipole of that
strength by bending a conducting ribbon of width dz into the shape
of the tile, and sending around this loop a current I = M0 dz (Fig.
10.160). That will give the loop a dipole moment:

m=Lxarea= Mcdz
c a

da. : M da dz (40)

which is the same as that of the tile.

Let us substitute such a current loop for every tile in the slab, as
indicated in Fig. 10.l6d. The current is the same in all of these and
therefore, at every interior boundary we find equal and opposite
currents, equivalent to zero current. Our ``egg-crate'' of loops is
therefore equivalent to a single ribbon running around the outside,
carrying the current Mc dz (Fig. 10.l6e). Now these tiles can be
made quite small, so long as we don't subdivide clear down to molecular
size. They must be large enough so that their magnetization
does not vary appreciably from one tile to the next. Within that
limitation, we can state that the field at any external point, even close
to the slab, is the same as that of the current ribbon.

It remains only to reconstruct a whole block from such lamina-
tions, or slabs, as in Fig. 10.l7a. The entire block is then equivalent
to the wide ribbon in Fig. 10. 1712 around which flows a current Mc dz,

in esu/ sec, in every strip dz, or, stated more simply, a surface current
of density <9, in (esu/sec)/cm, given by

é] = M0 (41)

The magnetic field B at any point outside the magnetized block in
Fig. l0.l7a, and even close to the block provided we don't approach
within molecular distances, is the same as the field B' at the corresponding
point in the neighborhood of the wide current ribbon in
Fig. 10.1719.

But what about the field inside the magnetized block? Here we
face a question hke the one we met in Chap. 9. Inside matter the
magnetic field is not at all uniform if we observe it on the atomic
scale which we have been calling ``microscopic.'' It varies sharply
in both magnitude and direction between points only a few angstroms
apart. This microscopic field B is simply a magnetic field in vacuum,
for from the microscopic viewpoint, as we emphasized in Chap. 9,
matter is a collection of particles and electric charge in otherwise

% p. 383
empty space. The only large-scale field that can be uniquely defined
inside matter is the spatial average of the microscopic field.

Because of the absence of effects attributable to magnetic charge,
we believe that the microscopic field itself satisfies div B = 0. If that
is true, it follows quite directly that the spatial average of the internal
microscopic field in our block is the same as the field B' inside the
equivalent current ribbon.

To demonstrate this, consider the long rod uniformly magnetized
parallel to its length, shown in Fig. l0.18a. We have just shown that
the external field will be the same as that of the long cylinder of current
(practically equivalent to a single-layer solenoid) shown in
Fig. 10.1819. S in Fig. lO.l8a indicates a closed surface which includes
a portion of S1 passing through the interior of the rod.
Because div B = 0 for the internal microscopic field, as well as for
the external field, div B is zero throughout the entire volume enclosed
by S. It then follows from Gauss's theorem that the surface integral
of B over S must be zero. The surface integral of B' over the closed
surface S' is zero also. Over the portions of S and S' external to the
cylinders, B and B' are identical. Therefore the surface integral of B
over the internal disk S1 must be equal to the surface integral of B'
over the internal disk Si. This must hold also for any one of a closely
spaced set of parallel disks, such as S2, S3, etc., indicated in
Fig. 10.18c, because the field outside the cylinder in this neighborhood
is negligibly small, so that the outside parts don't change any-
thing. Now taking the surface integral over a series of equally spaced
planes like that is a perfectly good way to compute the volume
average of the field B in that neighborhood, for it samples all volume
elements impartially. It follows that the spatial average of the microscopic
field B inside the magnetized rod is equal to the field B' inside
the current sheath of Fig. 10.1%.

It is instructive to compare the arguments we have just developed
with our analysis of the corresponding questions in Chap. 9. Figure
10.19 displays these developments side by side. You will see that
they run logically parallel, but that at each stage there is a dilference
which reflects the essential asymmetry epitomized in the observation
that electric charges are the source of electric fields, while moving
electric charges are the source of magnetic fields. For example, in
the arguments about the average of the microscopic field, the key
to the problem in the electric case is the assumption that curl E = 0
for the microscopic electric field. In the magnetic case, the key is
the assumption that div B = 0 for the microscopic magnetic field.

If the magnetization M within a volume of material is not uniform

but instead varies with position as M(x,y,z), the equivalent current
distribution is given simply by

J = c curl M (42)

Let's see how this comes about in one situation. Suppose there is a
magnetization in the z direction, which gets stronger as we proceed
in the y direction. This is represented in Fig. 10.20a, which shows a

% p. 386
small region in the material subdivided into little blocks. The blocks
are supposed to be so small that we may consider the magnetization
uniform within a single block. Then we can replace each block by
a current ribbon, with surface current density 67 = cMz. The current
I carried by such a ribbon, if the block is Az in height, is é] Az
or cM2 Az. Now each ribbon has a bit more current density than
the one to the left of it. The current in each loop is greater than the

10.9 The Field of a Permanent Magnet

The uniformly polarized spheres and rods we talked about in
Chap. 9 are seldom seen, even in the laboratory. Frozen-in electric
polarization can occur in some substances, although it is usually
disguised by some accumulation of free charge. To make Fig. lO.3a,
which shows how the field of a polarized rod would look, it was necessary
to use two charged disks. On the other hand, materials with
permanent magnetic polarization, that is, permanent magnetization,
are familiar and useful. Permanent magnets can be made from many

% p. 387
alloys and compounds of the ferromagnetic substances. What
makes this possible is a question we'll leave for Sec. 10.11, where we
dip briefly into the physics of ferromagnetism. In this section, taking
the existence of permanent magnets for granted, we want to study
the magnetic field B of a uniformly magnetized cylindrical rod, and
compare it carefully with the electric field E of a uniformly polarized
rod of the same shape.

Figure 10.21 shows each of these solid cylinders in cross section.
The polarization, in each case, is parallel to the axis, and it is uni-
form. That is, the polarization P and the magnetization M have the
same magnitude and direction everywhere within their respective
cylinders. In the magnetic case this implies that every cubic millimeter
of the permanent magnet has the same number of lined-up
electron spins, pointing in the same direction. (A very good approximation
to this can be achieved with modern permanent magnet
materials.)

By the field inside the cylinder we mean, of course, the macroscopic
field defined as the space average of the microscopic field.
With this understanding, we show in Fig. 10.2] the field lines both
inside and outside the rods. By the way, these rods are not supposed
to be near one another; we only put the diagrams together for convenient
comparison. Each rod is isolated in otherwise field-free

space. (Which do you think would more seriously disturb the field
of the other, if they were close together?)

Outside the rods the fields E and B look alike. In fact the field
lines follow precisely the same course. That should not surprise
you if you recall that the electric dipole and the magnetic dipole have
similar ``far fields.'' Each little chunk of the magnet is a magnetic
dipole, each little chunk of the polarized rod (sometimes called an
``electret'') is an electric dipole, and the field outside is the superposition
of all their far fields.

The field B, inside and out, is the same as that of a cylindrical
sheath of current. In fact if we were to wind very evenly, on a cardboard
cylinder, a single-layer solenoid of fine wire, we could hook
a battery up to it and duplicate the exterior and interior field B of
the permanent magnet. (The coil would get hot and the battery
would run down; electron spins provide the current free and friction-
less!) The electric field E, both inside and outside the polarized rod,
is that of two disks of charge, one at each end of the cylinder.

Observe that the interior fields E and B are essentially different
in form: B points to the right, is continuous at the ends of the

% p. 388
cylinder, and suffers a sharp change in direction at the cylindrical
surface. E points to the left, passes through the cylindrical surface
as if it weren't there, but is discontinuous at the end surfaces. These
differences arise from the essential difference between the ``inside''
of the physical electric dipole, and the ``inside'' of the physical magnetic
dipole, seen in Fig. 10.8. By physical, we mean the ones
Nature has actually provided us with.

If the external field were our only concern, we could use either
picture to describe the field of our magnet. We could say that the
magnetic field of the permanent magnet arises from a layer of positive
magnetic charge --- a surface density of ``north'' magnetic poles --- 
on the right-hand end of the magnet, and a layer of negative magnetic
charge, ``south'' poles, on the other end. We could adopt a scalar
potential function cpmag, such that B =  --- grad (pmas. The potential
function tpmag would be related to the fictitious pole density as the
electric potential is related to charge density. The simplicity of the
scalar potential compared to the vector potential is rather appealing.
Moreover, the magnetic scalar potential can be related in a very neat
way to the currents that are the real source of B, and thus one can use
the scalar potential without any explicit use of the fictitious poles.
You may want to use this device if you ever have to design magnets
or calculate magnetic fields.

We must abandon the magnetic pole fiction, however, if we want
to understand the field inside the magnetic material. That the
macroscopic magnetic field inside a permanent magnet is, in a very
real sense, like the field in Fig. 10.2119 rather than the field in
Fig. lO.2la has been demonstrated experimentally by deflecting
energetic charged particles in magnetized iron, as well as by the magnetic
effects on slow neutrons, which pass even more easily through
the interior of matter.

Figure 10.22a shows a small disk-shaped permanent magnet, in
which the magnetization is parallel to the axis of symmetry. You
are probably more familiar with permanent magnets in the shape of
long bars. However, flat disk magnets of considerable strength can
be made with certain new materials. The dimensions in this example
were chosen the same as the dimensions of the electrically polarized
disk in Fig. 9.21. The magnetization M is given as 150 in
CGS units. The magnetic moment of the electron is 0.93 x l0'2°
erg/gauss, so this value of M corresponds to 1.6 )< 102? lined-up
electron spins, per cubic centimeter. The disk is equivalent to a
band of current around its rim, of surface density <3 = cM. The rim

% p. 389
being 0.3 cm wide, the current I amounts to
0.3cM = (0.3) (3 x 101°)(15O)

or 1.35 x 1012 esu/sec. In practical units this is 450 amperes --- 
rather more current than you draw by short-circuiting an automobile
battery! The field B at any point in space, including points inside
the disk, is simply the field of this band of current. For instance,
near the center of the disk, B is approximately:

_ 27rI _ 277(0.3cM) _ 277(O.3)(l50)
_  --- rc_ _ rc _ (1.0)

B = 280 gauss (47)

The approximation consists in treating the 0.3-cm-wide band of cur-

rent as if it were concentrated in a simple ring. (In the corresponding
approximation in the electrical example we treated the equivalent
charge sheets as large compared to their separation.) As for
the field at a distant point, it would be easy to compute it for the
ring current, but we could also, for an approximate calculation,
proceed as we did in the electrical example. That is we could find
the total magnetic moment of the object, and find the distant field
of a single dipole of that strength.

10.10 Free Currents, and the Field H

It is often useful to distinguish between bound currents and free
currents. Bound currents are currents associated with molecular
or atomic magnetic moments, including the intrinsic magnetic
moment of particles with spin. These are the molecular current
loops envisioned by Ampere, the source of the magnetization we
have just been considering. Free currents are ordinary conduction
currents flowing on macroscopic paths --- currents that can be started
and stopped with a switch and measured with an ammeter.

The current density J in Eq. 42 is the macroscopic average of the
bound currents, so let us henceforth label it Jbound:

Jbound : c curl M (48)

At a surface where M is discontinuous, such as the side of the magnetized
block in Fig. 10.17, we have a surface current density :7 which
also represents bound current.

We found that B, both outside matter and, as a space average,
inside matter, is related to Jbmmd just as it is to any current density.

% p. 390
That is, curl B = (471/c)Jb0.md. But that was in the absence of free
currents. If we bring these into the picture, the field they produce

simply adds on to the field caused by the magnetized matter and
we have

Curl B = i(:‘7T_(Jbound ‘l' Jfree) ,: 4777 Jtotal 

Let us express Jbound in terms of M, through Eq. 48. Then Eq. 49
becomes

curl B = 47''(c curl M) + 4T''J,,,, (50)
which can be rearranged as
curl (B  ---  477M) = 4T''J,,,, (51)

If we now define a vector function H(x,y,z) at every point in space
by the relation

H = B  ---  47rM (52)
Eq. 51 can be written
curl H = 4T7TJ;,ee (53)

In other words, the vector H, defined by Eq. 52, is related to the
free current in the way B is related to the total current, bound plus
free. The parallel is not complete however, for we always have
div B = 0, whereas our vector function H does not necessarily have
zero divergence.

This surely has reminded you of the vector D which we introduced,
a bit grudgingly, in the last chapter. D, remember, was related to
the free charge as E is related to the total charge. Although we rather
disparaged D, the vector H is really useful, for a practical reason that
is worth understanding. In electrical systems, what we can easily
control and measure are the potential differences of bodies, and not
the amounts of free charge on them. Thus we control the electric
field E directly. D is out of our direct control, and since it is not a
fundamental quantity in any sense, what happens to it is not of much
concern. In magnetic systems, however, it is precisely the free currents
that we can most readily control. We lead them through wires,
measure them with ammeters, channel them in well-defined paths

% p. 391
with insulation, and so on. We have much less direct control, as a

rule, over magnetization, and hence over B. So the auxiliary vector
H is useful, even if D is not.

The integral relation equivalent to Eq. 53 is
. _ .41 . _ fl
fCH d1. 0 SJfree da ---  0 Ifree (54)

where Ifm is the total current enclosed by the path C. Suppose we
wind a coil around a piece of iron and send through this coil a certain
current I which we can measure by connecting an ammeter in
series with the coil. This is the free current, and it is the only free
current in the system. Therefore one thing we know for sure is the
line integral of H around any closed path, whether that path goes
through the iron or not. The integral depends only on the number
of turns of our coil that are linked by the path, and not on the magnetization
in the iron. The determination of M and B in this system
may be rather complicated. It helps to have singled out one quantity
that we can determine quite directly.

Figure 10.23 illustrates this property of H by an example, and is
a reminder of the units we may use in a practical case. H has the

% p. 392
same dimensions as B; in the Gaussian CGS system they are related
in exactly the same way to current in esu/sec. As you know, the
unit of magnetic field strength B in this system is named the gauss.
There was no compelling need for a different name for the unit of H.
Nevertheless, people who like to name things have given the unit
of H a name all its own, the oerstedj‘ Because you will find this
name used elsewhere, we have introduced it in Fig. 10.23.

We consider B the fundamental magnetic field vector because the
absence of magnetic charge, which we discussed in Sec. 10.2, implies
div B = 0 everywhere, even inside atoms and molecules. From
div B = 0 it follows, as we showed in Sec. 10.8, that the average
macroscopic field inside matter is B, not H. The implications of
this have not always been understood or heeded in the past. Further-
more, H has the practical advantage we have already explained. In
some older books you will find H introduced as the primary magnetic
field. B is then defined as H + 477M, and given the name magnetic
induction. Even some modern writers who treat B as the primary
field feel obliged to call it the magnetic induction because the name
magnetic field was historically preempted by H. This seems clumsy
and pedantic. If you go into the laboratory and ask a physicist what
causes the pion trajectories in his bubble chamber to curve, he'll
probably answer ``magnetic field,'' not ``magnetic induction.'' You
will seldom hear a geophysicist refer to the earth's magnetic induc-
tion, or an astronomer talk about the magnetic induction in the
Galaxy. We propose to keep on calling B the magnetic field. As
for H, although other names have been invented for it, we shall call
it ``the field H,'' or even, ``the magnetic field H.''

It is only the names that give trouble, not the symbols. Everyone
agrees that in the Gaussian CGS system the relation connecting B,
M, and H is that stated in Eq. 52. In vacuum there is no essential
distinction between B and H, for M must be zero where there is no
matter. You will often see Maxwell's equations for the vacuum fields
written with E and H, rather than E and B.

These remarks about names and units are not relevant to the MKS
electrical unit system. In that system quantities corresponding to
our B and H, and denoted by the same symbols, are treated as
dimensionally different and their numerical values differ even in
vacuum. (See Appendix.)

TMeasuring B in gauss and H in oersteds is like expressing the radius of a circle in
centimeters, but reserving a special name, such as ``are centimeter,'' for the unit of distance
measured around the circumference!

% p. 393
We should note here too that the accepted definition of the volume

magnetic susceptibility X", is not the logically preferable one given
in Eq. 39, but rather:

M = X,,,H (55)

The permanent magnet in Fig. 10.2119 is an instructive example
of the relation of H to B and M. To obtain H at some point inside
the magnetized material, we have to add vectorially to the magnetic
field B at that point the vector  --- 47rM. Figure 10.24 depicts this
for a particular point P. It turns out that the lines of H inside the
magnet look just like the lines of E inside the polarized cylinder of
Fig. 10.21a. That is as it should be, for if magnetic poles really were
the source of the magnetization, rather than electric currents, the
macroscopic magnetic field inside the material would be H, not B,
and the similarity of magnetic polarization to electric polarization
would be complete.

In the permanent magnet there are no free currents at all. Con-
sequently, the line integral of H, according to Eq. 54, must be zero
around any closed path. You can see that it will be if the H lines
really look like the E lines in Fig. l0.2la, for we know the line integral
of that electrostatic field is zero around any closed path. In this
example of the permanent magnet, Eq. 55 does not apply. The
magnetization vector M is not proportional to H but is determined,
instead. by the previous treatment of the material. How this can
come about will be explained in the next section.

For any material in which M is proportional to H, so that Eq. 55
applies as well as the basic relation, Eq. 52, we have:

B = H + 477M = (1 + 47rx,,,)H (56)

B is then proportional to H. The factor of proportionality,
(1 + 47rX,,,). is called the magnetic permeability and denoted usually
by it:

B = pH (57)

The permeability ,u, rather than the susceptibility X, is customarily
used in describing ferromagnetism.

10.11 Ferromagnetism _

Ferromagnetism has served and puzzled man for a long time.
The lodestone (magnetite) was known in antiquity, and the influence
on history of iron in the shape of compass needles was perhaps second
only to that of iron in the shape of swords. For nearly a century
our electrical technology has depended heavily on the circumstance
that one abundant metal happens to possess this peculiar property.
Nevertheless, it is only in recent years that anything like a fundamental
understanding of ferromagnetism has been achieved.

We have already described some properties of ferromagnets. In
a very strong magnetic field the force on a ferromagnetic substance
is in such a direction as to pull it into a stronger field, as for para-
magnetic materials, but instead of being proportional to the product
of the field B and its gradient, the force is proportional to the gradient
itself. As we remarked at the end of Sec. 10.4, this suggests
that if the field is strong enough, the magnetic moment acquired by
the ferromagnet reaches some limiting magnitude. The direction
of the magnetic moment vector must still be controlled by the field,
for otherwise the force would not always act in the direction of increasing
field intensity.

In ``permanent'' magnets we observe a magnetic moment even in
the absence of any externally applied field, and it maintains its magnitude
and direction even when external fields are applied, if they
are not too strong. The field of the permanent magnet itself is always
present of course, and you may wonder whether it could not keep
its own sources lined up. However, if you look again at Fig. 10.2112
or Fig. 10.24, accepting the assurance that this does represent a real
magnet, you will notice that M is generally not parallel to either B
or H. This suggests that the magnetic dipoles must be clamped in
direction by something other than purely magnetic forces.

The magnetization observed in ferromagnetic materials is much
larger than we are used to in paramagnetic substances. Permanent
magnets quite commonly have fields in the range of a few thousand
gauss. A more characteristic quantity is the limiting value of the
magnetization, the magnetic moment per unit volume, which the
material acquires in a very strong field. This is called the saturation

magnetization. We can deduce the saturation magnetization of iron
from the data in the table (Sec. 10.11. In a field with a gradient of

% p. 395
1700 gauss/cm, the force on 1 gm of iron was 4 x 105 dynes. From
Eq. 18, which relates the force on a dipole to the field gradient, we find

m _ F _ 4 x 105 dynes
_ (dB/dz) _ 1700 gauss/cm
= 235 ergs/gauss (for 1 gm) (58)

To get the moment per cubic centimeter we multiply m by the
density of iron, 7.8 gm/cm3. The magnetization M is thus

M = 235 )< 7.8 = 1830 ergs/gauss-cm3 (59)

It is 4¢rM, not M, that we should compare with field strengths in gauss.
For instance, if we had a very long rod of iron which had this amount
of magnetization as a permanent magnet, the field H inside would
be quite small (imagine the situation in Fig. 10.2119 stretched out
axially) so the field B in the iron would be approximately equal to
47rM, or some 23,000 gauss.

It is more interesting to see how many electron spin moments this
magnetization corresponds to. Dividing M by the electron moment
given in Fig. 10.14, 0.93 X l0‘20 erg/gauss, we get about 2 X 1023
spin moments per cubic centimeter. Now 1 cm3 of iron contains
about 1023 atoms. The limiting magnetization seems to correspond
to about two lined-up spins per atom. As most of the electrons in
the atom are paired off and have no magnetic effect at all, this indicates
that we are dealing with substantially complete alignment
of those few electron spins in the atom's structure that are at liberty
to point in the same direction.

A very suggestive fact about ferromagnets is this: A given ferromagnetic
substance, pure iron for example, loses its ferromagnetic
properties quite abruptly if heated to a certain temperature. Above
770°C. pure iron acts like a paramagnetic substance. Cooled below
770°C, it immediately recovers its ferromagnetic properties. This
transition temperature, called the Curie point after Pierre Curie who
was one of its early investigators. is different for different substances.
For pure nickel it is 358°C.

What is this ``ferromagnetic behavior'' which so sharply distinguishes
iron below 770°C from iron above 770°C, and from copper
at any temperature? It is the spontaneous lining up in one direction
of the atomic magnetic moments, which implies the alignment of
the spin axes of certain electrons in each iron atom. By spontaneous,
we mean that no external magnetic field need be involved. Over a
region in the iron large enough to contain millions of atoms, the spins
and magnetic moments of nearly all the atoms are pointing in the

% p. 396
 

same direction. Well below the Curie point --- at room temperature,
for instance, in the case of iron --- the alignment is nearly perfect.
If you could magically look into the interior of a crystal of metallic
iron and "see the elementary magnetic moments as vectors with
arrowheads on them, you might see sometlnflg like Fig. 10.25.

It is hardly surprising that a high temperature should destroy this
neat arrangement. Thermal energy is the enemy of order, so
to speak. A crystal, an orderly arrangement of atoms, changes to a
liquid, a much less orderly arrangement, at a sharply defined tem-
perature, the melting point. The melting point, like the Curie point,
is dilferent for different substances. The analogy goes deeper, but it
involves ideas that are better left for your study of heat and statistical
physics in the latter part of the course. Let us concentrate here on
the ordered state itself. Two or three questions are obvious:

Question 1: What makes the spins line up and keeps them lined
up?

Question 2: How, if there is no external field present, can the
spins choose one direction rather than another? Why didn't all the
moments in Fig. 10.25 point down, or to the right, or to the left?

Question 3: If the atomic moments are all lined up, why isn't every
piece of iron at room temperature a strong magnet?

The answers to these three questions will help us to understand,
in a general way at least, the behavior of ferromagnetic materials
when an external field, neither very strong nor very weak, is applied.

That includes a very rich variety of phenomena which we haven't
even described yet.

Answer 1: For some reason connected with the quantum mechanics
of the structure of the iron atom, it is energetically favorable
for the spins of adjacent iron atoms to be parallel. This is not due
to their magnetic interaction. It is a stronger effect than that, and
moreover, it favors parallel spins whether like this M‘ or like this  --- > --- >
(dipole interactions don't work that way --- see Prob. 9.26). Now if
atom A (Fig. 10.26) wants to have its spin in the same direction as
that of its neighbors, atoms B, C, D, and E, and each of them prefers
to have its spin in the same direction as the spins of its neighbors,
including atom A, you can readily imagine that if a local majority
ever develops there will be a strong tendency to ``make it unani-
mous,'' and then the fad will spread.

% p. 397
Answer 2: Accident somehow determines which of the various
equivalent directions in the crystal is chosen, if we commence from
a disordered state --- as, for example, if the iron is cooled through its
Curie point without an';' external field applied. Pure iron consists of
body-centered cubic crystals. Each atom has eight nearest neigh-
bors. The symmetry .11‘ the environment imposes itself on every
physical aspect of the atom, including the coupling between spins.
In iron the cubic axes happen to be the axes of easiest magnetization.
That is, the spins like to point in the same direction, but they like
it even better if that direction is one of the six directions, :52, :9,
:2 (Fig. 10.27). This is important because it means that the spins
cannot easily swivel around en masse from one of the easy directions
to an equivalent one at right angles. To do so, they would have to
swing through less favorable orientations on the way. It is just this
hindrance that makes permanent magnets possible.

Answer 3: An apparently unmagnetized piece of iron is actually
composed of many domains, in each of which the spins are all lined
up one way, but in a direction dilferent from that of the spins in
neighboring domains. On the average over the whole piece of
``unmagnetized'' iron, all directions are equally represented, so no
large-scale magnetic field results. Even in a single crystal the magnetic
domains establish themselves. The domains are usually microscopic
in the everyday sense of the word. In fact they can be made
visible under a low-power microscope. That is still enormous, of
course, on an atomic scale, so a magnetic domain typically includes
billions of elementary magnetic moments. Figure 10.28 depicts a
division into domains. The division comes about because it is
cheaper in energy than an arrangement with all the spins pointing
in one direction. The latter arrangement would be a permanent
magnet with a strong field extending out into the space around it.
The energy stored in this exterior field is larger than the energy
needed to turn some small fraction of the spins in the crystal, namely
those at a domain boundary, out of line with their immediate neigh-

bors. The domain structure is thus the outcome of an energy-
minimization contest.

If we wind a coil of wire around an iron rod, we can apply a magnetic
field to the material by passing a current through the wire. In
this field, moments pointing parallel to the field will have a lower
energy than those pointing antiparallel, or in some other direction.
This favors some domains over others; those that happen to have a

% p. 398
 

favorably oriented moment direction"? will tend to grow at the expense
of the others, if that is possible. A domain grows like a club,
that is, by expanding its membership. This happens at the bound-
aries. Spins belonging to an unfavored domain but located next to
the boundary with a favored domain, simply switch allegiance by
adopting the favored direction. That merely shifts the domain
boundary, which is nothing more than the dividing surface between
the two classes of spins. This happens rather easily in single crystals.
That is, a very weak applied field can bring about, through boundary
movement, a very large domain growth, and hence a large overall
change in magnetization. Depending on the grain structure of the
material however, the movement of domain boundaries can be
diflicult.

If the applied field does not happen to lie along one of the ``easy''
directions (in the case of a cubic crystal, for example,) the exhaustion
of the unfavored domains still leaves the moments not pointing
exactly parallel to the field. It may now take a considerably stronger
field to pull them into line with the field direction so as to create
finally, the maximum magnetization possible.

Let us look at the large-scale consequences of this, as they appear
in the magnetic behavior of a piece of iron under various applied
fields. A convenient experimental arrangement is an iron torus,
around which are wound two coils (Fig. 10.29). This afl"ords a
practically uniform field within the iron, with no end effects to complicate
matters. By measuring the voltage induced in one of the
coils we can determine changes in flux (I), and hence in B inside the
iron. If we keep track of the changes in B, starting from B = O, we
always know what B is. A current through the other coil establishes
H, which we take as the independent variable. If we know B and H,
we can always compute M. It is more usual to plot B rather than M,
as a function of H. A typical B --- H curve for iron is shown in
Fig. 10.30. Notice that the scales on abscissa and ordinate are vastly
different. If there were no iron in the coil, 1 oersted would be worth
exactly 1 gauss. Instead, when the field H is only a few oersteds.
B has risen to thousands of gauss. Of course B and H here refer to

an average throughout the whole iron ring; the fine domain structure
as such never exhibits itself.

TWe tend to use spins and moments almost interchangeably in this discussion. The
moment is an intrinsic aspect of the spin and if one is lined up so is the other. To be
meticulous, we should remind the reader that in the case of the electron the magnetic
moment and angular momentum vectors point in opposite directions (Fig. 10.14).

% p. 399
Starting with ``unmagnetized'' iron, B = 0 and H = 0, increasing
H causes B to rise in a conspicuously nonlinear way, slowly at
first, then more rapidly, then very slowly, finally flattening off. What
actually becomes constant in the limit is not B but M. In this graph
however, since M = (B  ---  H) /477, and H < B, the difference between
B and 47rM is not appreciable.

The lower part of the B-H curve is governed by the motion of
domain boundaries, that is by the growth of ``right-pointing'' domains
at the expense of ``wrong-pointing'' domains. In the flattening
part of the curve, the atomic moments are being pulled by ``brute
force'' into line with the field. The iron here is an ordinary poly-
crystalline metal, so only a small fraction of the microcrystals will
be fortunate enough to have an ``easy'' direction lined up with the
field direction.

If we now slowly decrease the current in the coil, thus lowering H,
the curve does not retrace itself. Instead, we find the behavior given
by the dashed curve in Fig. 10.31. This irreversibility is called
hysteresis. It is largely due to the domain boundary movements'
being partially irreversible. The reasons are not obvious from anything
we have said, but are well understood by physicists who work
on ferromagnetism. The irreversibility is a nuisance, and a cause
of energy loss in many technical applications of ferromagnetic
materials --- for instance, in alternating-current transformers. But it
is indispensable for permanent magnetization, and for such applica-
tions, one wants to enhance the irreversibility. Figure 10.31 shows
the corresponding portion of the B-H curve for a good permanent
magnet alloy. Notice that H has to become 600 oersteds in the
reverse direction before B is reduced to zero. If the coil is simply
switched OH and removed, we are left with B at 13,000 gauss, called
the remanence. Since H is zero, this is essentially the same as the
magnetization M, except for the factor 472-. The alloy has acquired
a permanent magnetization, that is, one that will persist indefinitely
if it is exposed only to. weak magnetic fields. All the information
that is stored on magnetic tapes, from music to computer programs,
owes its permanence to this physical phenomenon. Magnetic com-

puter elements, magnetic core memories, and the like, involve the
same physics.
